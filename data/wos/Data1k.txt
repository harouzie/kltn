5	48	120	Medical 	 Senior Health  	 health economists; publications; production functions        	"This paper investigates the research productivity of U.S. health economists, both in the past five years and over their careers to date. We examine quantity of overall publications, as well as quantity within categories of journals. We study unique data from a 2005 survey of U.S. health economists who were members of the International Health Economics Association or the Health Economics Interest Group of AcademyHealth. Basic descriptives indicate that senior health economists have considerably greater five-year research productivity than less senior researchers. Roughly a third of health economists employed in economics departments report that publishing in non-economics journals is ""not recommended"" for promotion and tenure. Regression models indicate that the factors associated with greater productivity include: more hours spent per week on research, experience, and type of academic unit. The findings reported here offer insight, into the heterogeneity of health economists and contribute to our understanding of the productivity of academic economists more generally."
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Shells; Fracture; Discontinuous Galerkin; Cohesive zone; Parallel computing        	We propose a computational framework for the simulation of deformation and fracture in shells that is well suited to situations with widespread damage and fragmentation due to impulsive loading. The shell is modeled with a shear-flexible theory and discretized with a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method, while fracture is represented with a cohesive zone model on element edges. A key feature of the method is that the underlying shear-flexible shell theory enables the description of transverse shear fracture modes, in addition to the in-plane and bending modes accessible to Kirchhoff-Love thin shell formulations. This is especially important for impulsive loading conditions, where shear-off failure near stiffeners and supports is common. The discontinuous Galerkin formulation inherits the scalability properties demonstrated previously for large-scale simulation of fracture in solids, while avoiding artificial elastic compliance issues that are common in other cohesive model approaches. We demonstrate the ability of the framework to capture the transverse shear fracture mode through numerical examples, and the parallel computation capabilities of the method through the simulation of explosive decompression of the skin of a full-scale passenger aircraft fuselage.

5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 SPRM; selective progesterone receptor modulators; uterine leiomyoma; contraception        	Uterine leiomyomata are benign, monoclonal tumors arising from smooth muscle cells, which belong to one of the most common pathologies of the female genital system. Current pharmacotherapies (oral contraceptives, progestins, GnRH analogs) are ineffective or of limited use for long-term treatment. Although there is still much debate regarding their etiology it is very likely that progesterone and progesterone receptor play a key role in their development. Profound importance of progesterone in the female reproductive system has led to discovery of synthetic progesterone receptor ligands, which can poses the activity ranging from pure agonist activity trough mixed agonist/antagonist activity to pure antagonist activity Development of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRM) has created new therapeutic options and has great potential in a number of gynecologic indications. So far, ulipristal acetate has been approved for emergency contraception, mifepristone as a progesterone receptor antagonist because of the unique property of this compound for termination of pregnancy Recently the European Commission has authorized ulipristal acetate for the pre-operative treatment of uterine fibroids. Superior efficacy of ulipristal acetate versus placebo, to reduce excessive uterine bleeding and to reduce total fibroid volume prior to surgery was demonstrated. Moreover, non-inferior efficacy of ulipristal acetate versus Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)-agonist to reduce excessive uterine bleeding prior to surgery of uterine fibroids has been documented. Ulipristal acetate is also characterized by a superior side-effect profile in comparison to leuprolide acetate in terms of serum estradiol levels and the proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe hot flashes during treatment. Regarding safety profile, except elevation of liver enzymes after telapristone and onapristone treatment, to date no serious untoward effects of other SPRM have been reported. The issue of endometrial effects of these compounds remains to be resolved, although observation that intrinsic agonist activity of SPRM prevents endometrial proliferation may suggest future use of these agents in prevention of endometrial hyperplasia. Other promising applications, including endometriosis, endometrial cancel; Cushing's disease, Alzheimer disease or long-term contraception, are currently in development.
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 Battery; electricity pricing; hybrid energy storage system; photovoltaic (PV) power; power management; supercapacitor        	This paper proposes a supervisory power management system (PMS) for a grid interactive microgrid with a hybrid energy storage system. The key feature of the proposed PMS is reduced number of sensors required to implement the PMS. The PMS considers renewable power variation, grid availability, electricity pricing, and changes in local loads. It can detect the operating mode of system without measuring load currents and powers. A single-phase voltage source converter (VSC) transfers real power between dc grid and utility grid besides offering ancillary services such as harmonic mitigation, reactive power support, and unity power factor at the point of common coupling (PCC). In the proposed system, a better dc-link voltage regulation is achieved and the usage of supercapacitors reduces the current stress on the battery. The PMS also addresses extreme operating conditions such as load shedding, off-maximum power point tracking operation of photovoltaic, elimination of critical oscillation of hybrid energy storage systems power, islanded operation, and resynchronization with grid. The performance of the proposed PMS is verified by digital simulation and experimental studies.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 Hyperthyroidism; Stroke; Cerebral infarction; Blood-brain barrier        	Background: Hyperthyroidism as a risk factor for stroke is not conclusive. There are no definite data on the relationship between ischemic cerebrovascular injury and hyperthyroidism. This study was designed to define whether the outcomes of post-ischemic stroke injury are influenced by chronic hyperthyroidism. Methods: Two groups of hyperthyroid ( HT) and control euthyroid rats of equal numbers ( n=22) were included in the study. Hyperthyroidism was induced for 4 weeks by adding L-thyroxine ( 300 mu g/kg) to drinking water. The middle cerebral artery occlusion technique was used to induce focal cerebral ischemia. Neurological disability ( neurological deficit score [ NDS]) was evaluated after 24 hours, and the rats were sacrificed to obtain their brain. Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride ( TTC) staining and Evans Blue ( EB) extravasation were used to quantify cerebral infarct volume and cerebrovascular integrity disruption. Data analysis was done using SPSS, version 21. Results: Thyroid hormones levels, T3 ( 314+/-7 vs. 198+/-3 ng/dL; P=0.001) and T4 ( 9.8+/-0.3 vs. 3.08+/-0.07 mu g/dL; P=0.001), were significantly higher in the HT group than in the controls. Furthermore, most clinical signs seen in hyperthyroid patients were also present in the HT group. Comparison of the data on cerebral ischemia between the HT and control groups showed significant increases in the NDS ( 2.76+/-0.16 vs. 2.23+/-0.09; P=0.03), cerebral infarct volume ( 479+/-12 vs. 266+/-17 mm(3); P=0.001), and EB extravasation ( 50.08+/-2.4 vs. 32.6+/-1.2 mu g/g; P=0.001) in the former group. Conclusion: The intensified cerebral infarct size and cerebrovascular integrity disruption suggested that chronic hyperthyroidism aggravated post-stroke injury in the rats. More investigation is required to analyze the pathological mechanisms underlying the association between cerebrovascular disease and hyperthyroidism.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Social dynamics; Social models; Psychological stress; Socially buffered response; Stability diagrams        	"Recent work has introduced social dynamic models of people's stress-related processes, some including amelioration of stress symptoms by support from others. The effects of support may be ""direct"", depending only on the level of support, or ""buffering"", depending on the product of the level of support and level of stress. We focus here on the nonlinear buffering term and use a model involving three variables (and 12 control parameters), including stress as perceived by the individual, physical and psychological symptoms, and currently active social support. This model is quantified by a set of three nonlinear differential equations governing its stationary-state stability, temporal evolution (sometimes oscillatory), and how each variable affects the others. Chaos may appear with periodic forcing of an environmental stress parameter. Here we explore this model carefully as the strength and amplitude of this forcing, and an important psychological parameter relating to self-kindling in the stress response, are varied. Three significant observations are made: 1. There exist many complex but orderly regions of periodicity and chaos, 2. there are nested regions of increasing number of peaks per cycle that may cascade to chaos, and 3. there are areas where more than one state, e.g., a period-2 oscillation and chaos, coexist for the same parameters; which one is reached depends on initial conditions.

1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Buck-boost transitions; dc-dc power converters; dead-zone avoidance; digital control; noninverting buck-boost converter        	A new hysteresis window method is proposed as a solution for avoiding the operational dead zone that exists at the transition between buck and boost operating modes in all noninverting buck-boost converters. In addition, this method also eliminates the discontinuities in the converter's steady-state output voltage transfer characteristic, which is a function of the duty cycle. The converter's output voltage function is surjective and, therefore, smooth mode transitions are achieved. The negative effects of operating within the dead zone are shown by the presence of subharmonics in the output voltage, increased output voltage ripple, poor regulation, and the instability of the converter during the transition between buck and boost operating modes. The dead-zone avoidance technique proposed in this paper eliminates all these issues while at the same time ensures highly efficient operation of the converter. An additional advantage of the technique is its simplicity, which allows for implementation into low-cost digital signal controllers, as well as into analog control circuits. The advantageous features of the proposed approach were evaluated on the basis of comparisons with three other dead-zone avoidance approaches and the initial case, which does not utilize any dead-zone avoidance technique. All the experiments were carried out on a purpose-built prototype of a noninverting buck-boost converter with magnetically coupled inductors.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Essure micro-inserts; Hysteroscopic sterilization; Hydrosalpinges; In vitro fertilization; Permanent birth control; Pregnancy outcomes; Unintended pregnancies        	This was a retrospective review of all pregnancies reported after Essure in situ in the Netherlands. Pregnancies included those that were unintentional (resulting from lack of protocol adherence and/or misread confirmation tests) and those that were intentional (resulting from off-label use of Essure micro-inserts for hydrosalpinx closure before in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection with embryo transfer or in vitro fertilization with embryo transfer after regret of sterilization). The outcomes of 50 pregnancies in women with I or 2 micro-inserts in situ were evaluated. Eight unintended pregnancies and 18 intended pregnancies resulted in birth of a full-term healthy baby. Seven infants were delivered via cesarean-section. Two women delivered prematurely by C-section, (singleton after 34 weeks 1 day, twins after 35 weeks 3 days). All babies are healthy and without any congenital anomalies. There were 2 stillbirths after 20 weeks; however, it is unlikely that this was related to the presence of the micro-inserts. In conclusion, it is unlikely that the presence of intratubal micro-inserts interferes with implantation and the developing amniotic sac and fetus. (C) 2014 AAGL. All rights reserved.
5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 Mifepristone; RU486; Apoptosis Bax; Bcl-2        	An increase in apoptotic activity has been observed in both the rabbit and the rat endometria following treatment with RU486. The aim of this study was to assess whether Bax and Bcl-2 signaling, in response to RU486, could be crucial role players mediating apoptosis in the rat uterus during early pregnancy. RU486 is a partial progesterone (P4) and estrogen receptor antagonist, functioning to actively silence P4 receptor gene-associated transcription. Although an increase in apoptosis as a result of RU486 administration has been previously reported in rabbits, the specific apoptotic factors and pathways involved in driving this process have not yet been established. Immunofluorescent techniques were used to determine protein expression levels of both Box and Bcl-2 in RU486-treated endometria at days 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 of pregnancy. The Bax/Bcl-2 index was used to determine the overall pro- or anti-apoptotic setting at each day of pregnancy, following RU486 administration. Changes in the Bax and Bcl-2 gene expression levels as a consequence of RU486 administration were evaluated using RT-qPCR. Both the protein and gene expression analyses suggest that RU486 induces a change toward an overall anti-apoptotic signal within the Bax/Bcl-2 pathway. These results suggest that the observed increase in apoptosis following RU486 administration is not driven by a shift in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio toward cell death, when the P4 and estrogen receptors are partially inactivated by RU486, but is possibly regulated by another apoptotic pathway.

5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 APOE; Testosterone; Episodic memory; Middle-age; Gene-hormone interaction        	Age-related changes in testosterone are believed to be a key component of the processes that contribute to cognitive aging in men. The APOE-epsilon 4 allele may interact with testosterone and moderate the hormone's association with cognition. The goals of the present study were to examine the degree to which free testosterone is associated with episodic memory in a community-based sample of middle-aged men, and examine the potential interaction between free testosterone and the APOE-epsilon 4 allele. Data were used from 717 participants in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging. Average age was 55.4 years (standard deviation = 2.5). Significant positive associations were observed between free testosterone level and verbal episodic memory, as well as a significant interaction between free testosterone and APOE-epsilon 4 status. In epsilon 4 carriers free testosterone was positively associated with verbal episodic memory performance (story recall), whereas no association was observed in epsilon 4 noncarriers. Results support the hypothesis that APOE-epsilon 4 status increases susceptibility to other risk factors, such as low testosterone, which may ultimately contribute to cognitive decline or dementia.

1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Approximately digital control; Output rectifier; Transformer core imbalance; Voltage sensor        	A high-efficiency method is proposed to suppress magnetic core imbalance in phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) converters. Compared with conventional solutions, such as controlling peak current mode (PCM) or adding DC blocking capacitance, the proposed method has several advantages, such as lower power loss and smaller size, because the additional current sensor or blocking capacitor is removed. A time domain model of the secondary side is built to analyze the relationship between transformer core imbalance and cathode voltage of secondary side rectifiers. An approximate control algorithm is designed to achieve asymmetric phase control, which reduces the effects of imbalance. A 60 V/15 A prototype is built to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that the numerical difference of primary side peak currents between two adjacent cycles is suppressed from 2 A to approximately 0 A. Meanwhile, compared with the PCM solution, the efficiency of the PSFB converter is slightly improved from 93% to 93.2%.
2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Ideation; Attempts; Gender; Capability for suicide; Interpersonal needs; Domestic violence offenders; Psychiatric symptoms        	Little is known about risk factors for suicide ideation and attempts among domestic violence offenders. Guided by the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide, this cross-sectional study examined risk factors for suicide ideation and attempts among 312 men and 84 women arrested for domestic violence and mandated to attend batterer intervention programs. Men reported greater capability for suicide, but no gender differences were found in perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. After controlling for correlates of suicide ideation, perceived burdensomeness but not thwarted belongingness or its interaction with perceived burdensomeness associated with suicide ideation. Suicide attempters exhibited greater perceived burdensomeness, drug use and problems, borderline personality disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation, but not capability for suicide, than nonattempters. Gender did not moderate the associations of the IPTS constructs with suicide ideation and attempts. These findings parallel tests of the interpersonal psychological theory in other samples. Additional work is needed to identify factors that distinguish risk for suicide ideation from risk for suicide attempts among domestic violence offenders.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Machine learning; Real-time systems; Cost estimation; Classification system design        	Smart embedded systems often run sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms and are found in many areas like automotive, sports and medicine. The developer of such a system is often confronted with the accuracy-cost conflict as the resulting system should be as accurate as possible while being able to run on resource constraint hardware. This article introduces a method to support the solution of this design conflict with accuracy-cost reports. These reports compare classification systems regarding their classification rate (accuracy) and the mathematical operations and parameters of the working phase (cost). Our method is used to deduce the specific cost of various popular pattern recognition algorithms and to derive the overall cost of a classification system. We also show how our analysis can be used to estimate the computational cost for specific hardware architectures. A software toolbox to create accuracy-cost reports was implemented to facilitate the automatic classification system comparison with the presented methodology. The software is available for download and as supplementary material. We performed different experiments on synthetic and real-world data to underline the value of this analysis. Accurate and computationally cheap classification systems were easily identified. We were even able to find a better implementation candidate in an existing embedded classification problem. This work is the first step towards a comprehensive support tool for the design of embedded classification systems.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 CNTFET based Op-Amp; low Power; biomedical applications; sample and hold; HSPICE        	VLSI technology is being adopted widely nowadays for biomedical applications to improve healthcare diagnosis, monitoring and cure. Analog devices such as A/D converters for biomedical applications can be of modest precision but need to be very energy efficient in order to operate for decades. CNTFET can be the future alternative to be used in various high performance, low power devices. In this paper we have presented a low power CNTFET based two stage Op-Amp for biomedical A/D converters. A sample and hold circuit is also implemented using CNTFET based Op-Amp to be used in biomedical ADCs. Simulation results of CNTET based circuits are compared with MOSFET circuits. Results indicate improvement of power consumption up to 80%. The proposed circuit simulations are carried out in HSPICE. It is concluded that CNTFET based circuits can be prime choice for low power applications.

Many new solutions are obtained with the aid of this method. These solutions include hyperbolic function solutions, trigonometric function solutions and rational function solutions. These new solutions will be better help us to understand the physical phenomenon of the dispersive water wave equation.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 Interactive evolutionary computation; Interactive algorithms; Automatic algorithm design; Meta-level evolutionary algorithms        	In interactive evolutionary computation (IEC), each solution is evaluated by a human user. Usually the total number of examined solutions is very small. In some applications such as hearing aid design and music composition, only a single solution can be evaluated at a time by a human user. Moreover, accurate and precise numerical evaluation is difficult. Based on these considerations, we formulated an IEC model with the minimum requirement for fitness evaluation ability of human users under the following assumptions: They can evaluate only a single solution at a time, they can memorize only a single previous solution they have just evaluated, their evaluation result on the current solution is whether it is better than the previous one or not, and the best solution among the evaluated ones should be identified after a pre-specified number of evaluations. In this paper, we first explain our IEC model in detail. Next we propose a (mu + 1) ES-style algorithm for our IEC model. Then we propose an offline meta-level approach to automated algorithm design for our IEC model. The main feature of our approach is the use of a different mechanism (e.g., mutation, crossover, random initialization) to generate each solution to be evaluated. Through computational experiments on test problems, our approach is compared with the (mu + 1) ES-style algorithm where a solution generation mechanism is pre-specified and fixed throughout the execution of the algorithm.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 Extended state observer; fault diagnosis; flight control system; model identification; subspace method; two-stage Kalman filter        	Model-based fault diagnosis has attracted considerable attention from researchers and developers of flight control systems, thanks to its hardware simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the airplane model, which is adopted commonly in fault diagnosis, only exists theoretically and is linearized in approximation. For this reason, uncertainties such as system non-linearity and subjectivity will degrade the fault diagnosis results. In this paper, we propose a novel actuator fault diagnosis scheme for flight control systems based on model identification techniques. With this scheme, system identification can be achieved with a linear model that uses a closed-loop subspace model identification algorithm, and a non-linear model that uses an extended state observer and neural networks. On this basis, the current actuator fault is estimated using an adaptive two-stage Kalman filter. Finally, the non-linear six-degree-of-freedom model of a B747 airplane is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment, where the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified from fault diagnosis tests.

The aim of promoting of intelligent green building is to stimulate the architecture technology industry. This has been combined with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the concept of green building to provide a safe and healthy living environment. While doing this it will also aim to reduce carbon emissions and save energy. This study investigates intelligent green building policies and the promotion of progress in Taiwan. It probes into cases from 1988 to 2014. Key success factors are derived from analyzing and summarizing intelligent green building experiences in Taiwan. This is done through Secondary Data Analyses by: 1. Establishing clear norms and standards for intelligent green building design and improvement; 2. First carrying out policies in public sector, in order to provide field trial and safeguarded market opportunities for industries; 3. Implementing rating-based assessments, in order to raise the quality of design; 4. Mandatory or incentive policies are introduced, depending on local specialties and conditions; 5. Respectively planning incentives for relevant interested parties in industrial chain; 6. Strengthening marketing efforts and proactively promoting policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 Emotions; Semantic elaboration; Memory distortions; Remember/familiar judgements        	The present experiment was conducted to investigate whether negative emotionally charged and arousing content of to-be-remembered scripted material would affect propensity towards memory distortions. We further investigated whether elaboration of the studied material through free recall would affect the magnitude of memory errors. In this study participants saw eight scripts. Each of the scripts included an effect of an action, the cause of which was not presented. Effects were either negatively emotional or neutral. Participants were assigned to either a yes/no recognition test group (recognition), or to a recall and yes/ no recognition test group (elaboration + recognition). Results showed that participants in the recognition group produced fewer memory errors in the emotional condition. Conversely, elaboration + recognition participants had lower accuracy and produced more emotional memory errors than the other group, suggesting a mediating role of semantic elaboration on the generation of false memories. The role of emotions and semantic elaboration on the generation of false memories is discussed.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Adolescents/young adults' health; Risk-taking; Barriers to contraception; Mozambique        	Background: By focusing upon formal sex education programmes, the Mozambican government has significantly enhanced the general health of adolescents and young adults. However, when it comes to contraception, little is known about how adolescents and young adults actually behave. Methods: Based upon a qualitative study in two settings in Maputo province - Ndlavela and Boane - this paper explores the knowledge and practices of contraception among adolescents and young adults. A total of four focus group discussions, 16 in-depth interviews, four informal conversations, and observations were equally divided between both study sites. Results: Discrepancies between what adolescents and young adults know and what they do quickly became evident. Ambivalent and contradictory practices concerning contraceptive use was the result. As well, young people had numerous interpretations of risk-taking when not using contraceptives. These inconsistencies are influenced by social and medical barriers such as restricted dialogue on sexuality among adolescents and young adults and their parents and peers. Additionally, ideas about indigenous contraceptives, notions of masculinity and femininity, misconceptions and fear of the side effects of contraceptives, make people of all ages wary of modern birth control. Other barriers include imposed contraceptive choice - meaning no choice, overly technical medical language used at clinics and the absence of healthcare workers more attuned to the needs of adolescents and young adults. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults have numerous - often erroneous - opinions about contraception, leading to inconsistent use as well as vague perceptions of risk-taking. Moreover, social norms and cultural gender roles often contradict and hinder risk-avoiding behaviour. Therefore, in order to improve young people's health, policymakers must address the reasons behind this ambivalence and inconsistency.
2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Bipolar disorder; Borderline personality disorder; Comorbidity; Emotion regulation; Emotional dysregulation        	Background: Differentiation of the bipolar disorders (BP) from a borderline personality disorder (BPD) can be challenging owing to shared features, with emotional dysregulation being the likely principal one. Aim: To assess differences in emotion regulation strategies in those with BP alone, BPD alone and those comorbid for both. Methods: We interviewed participants previously receiving a BP or BPD diagnosis, studying those who met DSM criteria for one or both conditions. Results: The sample comprised 83 with bipolar disorder, 53 with BPD and 54 comorbid for both. Analyses established linear trends, with the greatest impairment in emotion regulation strategies in the comorbid group followed by the BPD group, and with the lowest in the BP group. Specific deficits in the comorbid group included impulsivity, difficulties with goal directed behaviour, and accessing strategies. A similar linear profile was quantified for maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, weighted to catastrophizing and rumination. Adaptive emotion regulation strategies were superior in the bipolar group, without significant differences observed between the comorbid and BPD groups. Limitations: Reliance on self-report measures; combined BP I and II participants limits generalisability of results to each bipolar sub-type; use of DSM diagnoses risking artefactual comorbidity; while there was an over-representation of females in all groups. Conclusions: Differences in emotion regulation strategies advance differentiation of those with either BP or BPD, while we identify the specificity of differing strategies to each condition and their synergic effect in those comorbid for both conditions. Study findings should assist the development and application of targeted strategies for those with either or both conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 placental abruption; cardiovascular disease; ischaemic placental disease; preterm delivery; prospective cohort study        	BackgroundCardiovascular (CVD) complications stemming from vascular dysfunction have been widely explored in the setting of preeclampsia. However, the impact of abruption, a strong indicator of microvascular disturbance, on the risk of CVD mortality and morbidity remains poorly characterised. MethodsWe designed a cohort analysis of 828289 women who delivered singletons in Denmark between 1978 and 2010. We linked the National Patient Registry and the Registry of Causes of Death to the Danish Birth Registry to ascertain CVD events. We estimated CVD risks in relation to abruption from Cox proportional hazards regression following adjustments for confounders. ResultsWith 13231562 person-years of follow-up of women with at least one delivery, 11829 pregnancies were complicated by abruption. The median (interquartile range) follow-up in the non-abruption and abruption groups was 16 (8, 24) and 18 (10, 25) years, respectively. CVD mortality rates in women with and without abruption were 0.9 and 0.3 per 10000 person-years, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5, 5.0). The corresponding CVD morbidity complication rates were 16.7 and 10.0 per 10000 person-years, respectively (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4, 1.8). The increased risks were evident for ischaemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease, non-rheumatic valvular disease, and congestive heart failure. ConclusionsThis study shows increased hazards of CVD morbidity and mortality in relation to abruption. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of distorted placental microvasculature is needed as this appears to be a harbinger of CVD later in life.
0	12	12	CS 	 Symbolic computation  	 Hirota bilinear form; lump solution; BKP equation        	Lump solutions are rationally localized in all directions in the space. A general class of lump solutions to the (2 + 1)-dimensional B-Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (BKP) equation is presented through symbolic computation with Maple. The Hirota bilinear form of the equation is the starting point in the computation process. Like the KP equation, the resulting lump solutions contain six arbitrary parameters. Two of the parameters are due to the translation invariances of the BKP equation with the independent variables, and the other four need to satisfy a nonzero determinant condition and the positivity condition, which guarantee analyticity and rational localization of the solutions.
5	37	109	Medical 	 Myelofibrosis  	 HDAC8; bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells; myeloproliferative neoplasm cell lines; apoptosis and myeloproliferative neoplasms        	Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in epigenetic modulation and their aberrant expression has been demonstrated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). HDAC8 inhibition has been shown to inhibit JAK2/STAT5 signaling in hematopoietic cells from MPN. Nevertheless, the role of HDAC8 expression in bone marrow-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) has not been assessed. In the current work we describe that HDAC8 is significantly over-expressed in MSC from in JAK-2 positive MPN compared to those from healthy-donors (HD-MSC). Using a selective HDAC8 inhibitor (PCI34051), we verified that the subsequent decrease in the protein and mRNA expression of HDAC8 is linked with an increased apoptosis of malignant MSC whereas it has no effects on normal MSC. In addition, HDAC8 inhibition in MPN-MSC also decreased their capacity to maintain neoplastic hematopoiesis, by increasing the apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest and colony formation of JAK2(+)-hematopoietic cells. Mechanistic studies using different MPN cell lines revealed that PCI34051 induced their apoptosis, which is enhanced when were co-cultured with JAK2V617F-MSC, decreased their colony formation and the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5. In summary, we show for the first time that the inhibition of HDAC8 in MSC from JAK2(+) MPN patients selectively decreases their hematopoietic-supporting ability, suggesting that HDAC8 may be a potential therapeutic target in this setting by acting not only on hematopoietic cells but also on the malignant microenvironment.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Radial basis function neural networks; Support vector machines; Matter-element extension model; Ecological stoichiometry; Degradation mechanism; Western Jilin Province        	The grasslands of Western Jilin Province in China have experienced severe degradation during the last 50 years. Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and support vector machines (SVM) were used to predict the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of Leymus chinensis (L. chinensis) and explore the degree of grassland degradation using the matter-element extension model. Both RBFNN and SVM demonstrated good prediction accuracy. The results indicated that there was severe degradation, as samples were mainly concentrated in the 3rd and 4th levels. The growth of L chinensis was shown to be limited by either nitrogen, phosphorus, or both during different stages of degradation. The soil chemistry changed noticeably as degradation aggravated, which represents a destabilization of L chinensis community homeostasis. Soil salinization aggravates soil nutrient loss and decreases the bioavailability of soil nutrients. This, along with the destabilization of C/N, C/P and N/P ratios, weakens the photosynthetic ability and productivity of L chinensis.

0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Ant colony optimization; Interactive optimization; Next release problem; Search based soft ware engineering        	The selection of which requirements should be implemented in the next software release is an important and complex task in the software development process, considering the presence of budget constraints and other conflicting aspects. In this context, search based software engineering, has the main objective of applying automatic search methods to solve complex software engineering problems. However, most of these methods do not consider human expertise during the search, especially due to the difficulty in mathematically modeling the user's preferences. Consequently, the user can present some resistance or place little confidence in the final results, given that his/her knowledge and domain expertise was not properly considered in the solution construction. This paper aims at proposing an interactive model for the next release problem using ant colony optimization, where the user can define which requirements he/she would like to include or not in the next release. Employing humans and a simulator, an empirical study was performed that considers real-world and artificial instances. The achieved results demonstrate that the loss of score was, on average, 12% when it was compared with a solution with no human intervention. On the other hand, the algorithm generates solutions that have more than 80% of the met preferences, as defined by the users. Furthermore, the results showed that ACO can be an interesting choice as an interactive search engine, given the low quantity of interactions that are required to reach good solutions.

5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Nitric oxide; Nitrates; Nitrites; Biomarkers; Chronic disease        	BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide and its metabolites, nitrate and nitrite, are important regulators linked to various diseases. We studied the association of fasting serum concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, combined as NOx, without special diet, with the prevalence of various chronic diseases. METHODS: Fasting concentrations of NOx were assayed in a cohort of 1087 patients recruited to Stress Aging and Health in Russia study that represents male and female population in Moscow, Russia, over 55 years of age. Chronic diseases were recorded based on anamnesis and additional assays were run to characterize immune status and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism Odds ratios were calculated to associate NOx concentrations with prevalence of chronic diseases in pooled deciles below or above borderline. RESULTS: NOx over 44.7 mu M were associated with increased prevalence of various chronic diseases such as diabetes type II, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, gout and thrombosis/stroke. NOx 65.3 mu M and above were associated with lowered prevalence of osteoporosis. NOx levels of 74.6 mu M and above were associated with significantly higher number of patients who abstain from consumption of alcoholic beverages. NOx were not associated with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, fasting concentrations of NOx in serum can be an important diagnostic parameter characteristic for specific chronic diseases.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Active RC filter; DC offset voltage; flicker noise; linearity improvement; low output impedance source follower; RF filter; Sallen-Key filter; source-follower-based filter        	This paper reports a source follower-based active RC filter topology for RF front-ends in wideband systems. In the proposed active RC filter, the noise figure and bandwidth are improved through adopting the proposed sub-1 Omega Z(out) source follower, which replaces the conventional operational amplifier-based unity gain buffer and through simply changing its location in the filter. Applying the proposed scheme to the conventional Sallen-Key filter also improves the stopband rejection performance. Furthermore, the proposed filter topology ultimately suppresses the DC offset voltage and flicker noise of the unity gain buffer, which is the only active circuit in the filter. The proposed biquad filter is implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS and the measurements exhibit >26 dBm IIP3, +12 dBm input P-1dB, and <15 dB noise figure over 50-450 MHz of a 6 bit tunable frequency range. The proposed biquad filter consumes 14 mA from a 1.8 V supply and the chip occupies 1000x500 mu m(2).
5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 Biomass fuel; Asthma severity; Possible asthma; Underdiagnosis; Rural children; Nigeria        	Background: In 2014, the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) reported that the highest prevalence of symptoms of severe asthma was found in the low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Nigeria. While exposure to biomass fuel use may be an important risk factor in the development of asthma, its association with asthma symptoms severity has not been well-established. The aim of this study is to extend the spectrum of environmental risk factors that may be contributing towards increasing asthma morbidity, especially asthma symptoms severity in rural schoolchildren in Nigeria and to examine possible asthma underdiagnosis among this population. Methods: Authors conducted a cross-sectional survey in three rural communities in Nigeria. Asthma symptoms were defined according to the ISAAC criteria. Information on the types of household fuel used for cooking was used to determine household cooking fuel status. Asthma symptoms severity was defined based on frequencies of wheeze, day-and night-time symptoms, and speech limitations. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore associations. Results: A total of 1,690 Nigerian schoolchildren participated in the study. Overall, 37 (2.2%) had diagnosed asthma and 413 (24.4%) had possible asthma (asthma-related symptoms but not diagnosed asthma). Children from biomass fuel households had higher proportion of possible asthma (27.7 vs. 22.2%; p < 0.05) and symptoms of severe asthma (18.2 vs. 7.6%; p = 0.048). In adjusted analyses, biomass fuel use was associated with increased odds of severe symptoms of asthma [odds ratios (OR) = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.16-4.84], but not with possible asthma (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.95-1.56). Conclusion: In rural Nigerian children with asthma symptoms, the use of biomass fuel for cooking is associated with an increased risk of severe asthma symptoms. There is additional evidence that rural children might be underdiagnosed for asthma.
5	8	80	Medical 	 Autism  	 Mindfulness; Developmental disabilities; Intellectual disabilities; Intervention; Adolescents; Families        	Research shows that there is a need to develop psychosocial interventions specifically for young people with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) and their families to optimize their mental health. In the present pilot study, an 8-week mindfulness-based group was conducted with eight adolescents with IDD and their parents. Qualitative evidence suggests that there may be some benefits to joint groups for youth and parents. Both parents and youth enjoyed the group and gained insight into themselves and each other. A trend was observed where youth participants' self-reported mood improved following each session and their social behaviours were reported by parents to improve as well. Some challenges were encountered, however. Despite parents' involvement in the group, some participants were reported to be resistant in practicing mindfulness skills outside of sessions. This study expands on the therapeutic modalities available for youth with IDD and their families, showing that 90 min mindfulness-based intervention may help youth with IDD learn how to manage their emotions from within.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 Alveolar bone loss; Biomarker; Menopause; Oestrogen; Saliva        	Introduction: Alkaline phosphatase is an intracellular destruction enzyme in the periodontium, and it takes part in the normal turnover of the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, and root cementum formation and maintenance. Aim: The aim of this case control study was to evaluate the enzyme Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) level in saliva of post menopausal women with and without chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: In this study, 40 individuals, satisfying the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, were recruited. They were categorically divided, on the basis of gingival index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, into two groups: Group I (post menopausal women with a clinically healthy periodontium, n= 20); and Group II (post menopausal women with generalized chronic periodontitis, n= 20). Clinical parameters assessed were Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) and Probing Pocket Depth (PPD). Unstimulated salivary samples were obtained in which the ALP concentration was measured using p-Nitrophenylphosphate, and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol reagents in Beckman and Coulter, AU 480 auto analyser. Mann-Whitney U test was used to find statistical difference with respect to all clinical parameters such as PI, GI, CAL, PPD and salivary ALP levels. Results: The mean ALP in saliva was found to be higher in Group II compared to Group I and the difference was statistically significant with the p-value of 0.008. Conclusion: A noteworthy increase in the ALP concentration was seen in saliva in our study (Group II) may be due to increased periodontal inflammation in post menopausal women. Thus salivary ALP can be taken as an additional biomarker to early diagnosis, development and progression of periodontitis especially among post menopausal women.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 cumulative trauma disorders; peripheral nervous system disease; electromyography; carpal tunnel syndrome; nerve compression syndromes; meat-packing industry        	Background: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a musculoskeletal condition that often impairs the fitness to work. Our aim is to retrospectively evaluate the association between physical exposures in meat processing industry in Northern Italy and the CTS, taking into account non-occupational factors. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed to include 434 workers (236 males, 198 females, 37.0 +/- 10.6 years old, working age: 12.6 +/- 10.8 years) from meat processing industries. Signs and symptoms were collected at the compulsory occupational medical surveillance. Occupational risk factors were assessed through a questionnaire and direct assessment by investigators. Adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) for factors of interest were estimated through binary logistic regression. Results: Diagnosis of the CTS was reported for 61 out of 434 subjects (14.1%) for an incidence of 11.3/1000 person-years. In general, signs and symptoms for the CTS were associated with the following demographic factors: smoking history (OR = 1.909, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.107-3.293), previous traumas of the upper limb (OR = 3.533, 95% CI: 1.743-7.165), hypothyroidism status (OR = 7.897, 95% CI: 2.917-21.38) and, in the case of female participants only, previous pregnancies (OR = 2.807, 95% CI: 1.200-6.566) as well as a personal history of oral contraceptive therapy and/or steroidal replacement therapy (OR = 11.57, 95% CI: 4.689-28.56). The carpal tunnel syndrome cases were associated with the following occupational factors (>4 h/day): forceful hand exertion (ORadj = 3.548, 95% CI: 1.379-9.131), repeated trauma of the hand (ORadj = 3.602, 95% CI: 1.248-10.395), repeated movements of the wrist (ORadj = 2.561, 95% CI: 1.100-5.960). Conclusions: Increasing levels of hand activity and force were associated with the increased CTS prevalence among participants. Recommendations have to be provided in order to reduce occupational exposure to these risk factors and improve medical surveillance.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 noise reduction; collateral filter; CUDA; GPU parallel computing; MRI        	Image denoising is one of the fundamental and essential tasks within image processing. In medical imaging, finding an effective algorithm that can remove random noise in MR images is important. This paper proposes an effective noise reduction method for brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. Our approach is based on the collateral filter which is a more powerful method than the bilateral filter in many cases. However, the computation of the collateral filter algorithm is quite time-consuming. To solve this problem, we improved the collateral filter algorithm with parallel computing using GPU. We adopted CUDA, an application programming interface for GPU by NVIDIA, to accelerate the computation. Our experimental evaluation on an Intel r Xeon r CPU E5-2620 v3 2.40GHz with a NVIDIA Tesla K40c GPU indicated that the proposed implementation runs dramatically faster than the traditional collateral filter. We believe that the proposed framework has established a general blueprint for achieving fast and robust filtering in a wide variety of medical image denoising applications.
0	11	11	CS 	 Structured Storage  	 information hiding; compound file; structured storage; VSTO plug-in        	Compound files information hiding technology has become a hot research topic in the field of information security. This paper proposes an information hiding method for compound files based on structured storage. In the method, by employing compound file principle of structured storage and VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) plug-in mechanism, some specific data (including user name, machine name, IP address, date and time etc.) can be stored in MS compound documents and they can not be detected by naked eyes. Experiment results show that the proposed method can store a large amount of data in MS (Microsoft) office files' internal structure with higher efficiency, easier implementation, and fewer time consuming.

4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 MSW compost plant; Leachate and runoff; Stream sediment pollution; Stream water pollution; Risk assessment        	We determined the levels of various heavy metals in water stream and sediments receiving leachate/runoff from open-air windrows of MSW compost plant of Sanandaj, (Kurdistan, Iran) and assessed the related contamination rate and ecological risk by determining the geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), ecological risk factor (ER), contamination degree (CD), pollution load index (PLI) and potential ecological risk (RI) of water and sediments. Our results showed that several heavy metals, except Cd, had concentrations higher than the maximum limits for sediments to protect aquatic life, using the Consensus-Based Sediment Quality Guidelines (CBSQG) as reference. Heavy metal concentrations in the stream water were higher than the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) limits for drinking, irrigation and for protection of an aquatic life, except for Cu and Zn. The evaluation results of the CD and PLI indices showed that the stream water and sediment pollution caused by uncontrolled emission from the open-air windrows composting of MSW, as the elements causing pollution were the same as those enriched in the compost. Values of the ER and RI indices indicated moderate to considerable ecological risk. We concluded that source separation of the MSW and effective control of runoff entering the composting plant are needed to protect the surrounding environment from the negative impact of the composting plant releases.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 organophosphorus hydrolase; secretion; Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS; Tat signal peptide        	Organophosphorus (OPs) compounds are widely used in many pesticides, insecticides, and chemical nerve agents. These compounds are hazardous for humans and the environment. There are many reports on detoxification of these compounds, among them enzymatic cleavage of these compounds with organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) has been taken into more consideration. Several studies have been performed to improve OPH secretion in Escherichia coli by different signal peptides, but have not been successful. In this study, to achieve the extracellular secretion of OPH in E. coli, the complete opd gene along with its native signal peptide was codon optimized and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The culture medium showed OPH activity after 2, 4, and 6 H of induction time. The extracellular secretion of OPH was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The effects of different factors in growth medium were also investigated regarding expression and extracellular secretion of OPH. It appears that the secretion of OPH into the extracellular medium is highly affected by culture conditions. Therefore, our results revealed that the recombinant OPH was successfully secreted into the extracellular medium. This secretion system can be considered as a high efficiency biocatalyst for detoxification of OPs compounds. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 Biological Markers; Carcinoma    Hepatocellular; Mass Spectrometry       	Background: Differentiation of malignant from benign liver tumors remains a challenging problem. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS) technique has emerged as a promising strategy to diagnose a wide range of malignant tumors. The purpose of this study was to establish classification models to distinguish benign and malignant liver tumors and identify the liver cancer-specific peptides by mass spectrometry. Material/ Methods: In our study, serum samples from 43 patients with malignant liver tumors and 52 patients with benign liver tumors were treated with weak cation-exchange chromatography Magnetic Beads (MB-WCX) kits and analyzed by the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Then we established genetic algorithm (GA), supervised neural networks (SNN), and quick classifier (QC) models to distinguish malignant from benign liver tumors. To confirm the clinical applicability of the established models, the blinded validation test was performed in 50 clinical serum samples. Discriminatory peaks associated with malignant liver tumors were subsequently identified by a qTOF Synapt G2-S system. Results: A total of 27 discriminant peaks (p<0.05) in mass spectra of serum samples were found by ClinPro Tools software. Recognition capabilities of the established models were 100% (GA), 89.38% (SNN), and 80.84% (QC); cross-validation rates were 81.67% (GA), 81.11% (SNN), and 86.11% (QC). The accuracy rates of the blinded validation test were 78% (GA), 84% (SNN), and 84% (QC). From the 27 discriminatory peptide peaks analyzed, 3 peaks of m/z 2860.34, 2881.54, and 3155.67 were identified as a fragment of fibrinogen alpha chain, fibrinogen beta chain, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), respectively. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that MS technique can be helpful in differentiation of benign and malignant liver tumors. Fibrinogen and ITIH4 might be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of malignant liver tumors.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Immunofluorescence; Paraffin-embedded sections; Triple staining; Quantification        	During a long time, immunofluorescence has been neglected to benefit of molecular biology especially genetics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses. These techniques give good results on cell culture but for organs that are made of numerous cells with several compartments, various states of differentiation as in epidermis, immunohistochemistry is always relevant. Double (triple) staining by immunofluorescence allows positive cells identification in complex cell structure (for example, pericytes and endothelial cells in vessels) and subcellular localizations. In order to, due to improvement of antibodies avoiding especially species cross-reactions, microscopy and specific softwares, quality of staining, and acquired images have been upgraded. Consequently, this technique permits, as molecular biology analyses, quantification of the level of expression as intensity of fluorescence can be measured in each cells and each compartments (nuclear, cytoplasmic). In order to immunofluorescence on cells and tissue needs few materials and gives at the same times qualitative and quantitative results and must be used more widely especially when a mutation was associated to a disease.
0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 Elementary education; Educational software; Computer programming        	Educators and parents alike are seeking innovative ways to introduce young students to computer programming. The hope is to capture children's attention and foster learning at the same time. The goal of this work was to not only introduce elementary students to the fundamentals of computer programming, but also help them explore more complex concepts in an engaging way. Studies have shown that factors that inspire children's continued interest can sometimes vary by gender at this age; this work specifically addresses how to incorporate elements that will appeal to these potential differences in motivation. This study describes the design and implementation of a computer microworld game designed to introduce the core constructs and techniques of computer programming. By instructing a virtual robot to complete obstacle courses, students become familiar with core programming concepts such as: algorithms, repetition, conditional logic, debugging, functions, and optimization. We conducted several interactive sessions with a group of elementary school students in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the game. Our results showed the game effectively familiarized students with both computer language constructs and the essentials of algorithmic thinking. Students were quickly able to learn core-programming concepts and apply these concepts to free form solutions.

ASD is a neuro-developmental disorder characterized by deficits in social responsiveness, impairments in verbal and nonverbal communication. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the relevance of e-learning technology to the area of training the caregivers of autistic children. Our search focused on a number of data banks that contain numerous references to autism and home based treatment. Our results found only ten papers published since 2010 that met our criteria for inclusion. Six were demonstrations of e learning to teach caregivers and professionals the basics of applied behavior analysis and some techniques for skill training. The remainder of the studies fell into the telehealth category which involved direct communication between a professional and caregiver in the home. The studies suggest that home based service delivery is effective and offers both the social service system and parents considerable financial savings. The use of Web based platform (e learning and telehealth) is depicted as an aid to caregivers of autistic children. The need for more studies of the variables related to home based service delivery is noted."
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 5G; network security; digital signature; proxy signature; chameleon hash        	5G mobile networks are promising to offer mobile users unrivaled experiences with infinite networking capability at any period and from anywhere. However, it appears unnecessary and impractical for the customers and servers to be connected permanently in wireless networks because battery life is a bottleneck in such kind of networks. Therefore, the authorized entity needs to delegate its right to others in order to ensure the services available. This paper aims to address the issue of delegating authentication in 5G networks by proposing a new proxy signature scheme with efficient proxy signing operations. Concretely, we present a new and efficient proxy signature algorithm whose unforgeability can be reduced to the well-known discrete logarithm assumption. In the proposal, the original signer delegates his signing right by signing an exposure-free chameleon hash value on the warrant, and the proxy signer can generate a proxy signature on a message only by calculating a chameleon hash collision between the warrant and the message. This approach is computationally cost-effective for the proxy signer. Further analysis of the new scheme demonstrates that it offers the desirable properties of delegation of signing sights.

2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 Caregiving; Social cognition; Social development        	Considerable research has examined infants' understanding and evaluations of social agents, but two questions remain unanswered: First, do infants organize observed social relations into larger structures, inferring the relationship between two social beings based on their relations to a third party? Second, how do infants reason about a type of social relation prominent in all societies: the caregiving relation between parents and their babies? In a series of experiments using animated events, we ask whether 15- to 18-month-old infants infer that two babies who were comforted by the same adult, or two adults who comforted the same baby, will affiliate with one another. We find that infants make both of these inferences, but they make no comparable inferences when presented with the same visible events with voices that specify a peer context, in which one adult responds to another laughing adult. Thus, infants are sensitive to at least one aspect of caregiving and organize relations between infants and adults into larger social structures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NMR experiments provide evidence of NF11's ability to inhibit fibril formation, primarily through interaction with the N-terminus region as well as the central hydrophobic cluster of A beta 40. NF11 has micromolar binding affinity toward both monomeric and aggregated species for efficient clearance of toxic aggregates. From these in vitro results, the future development of a next generation peptidomimetic therapeutic agent for amyloid disease may be possible.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Mediation; Guided self-help; Externalizing behavior; Parental attributions        	Parent training (PT) delivered as a guided self-help intervention may be a cost- and time-effective intervention in the treatment of children with externalizing disorders. In face-to-face PT, parenting strategies have repeatedly been identified as mediating mechanisms for the decrease of children's problem behavior. Few studies have examined possible mediating effects in guided self-help interventions for parents. The present study aimed to investigate possible mediating variables of a behaviorally oriented guided self-help program for parents of children with externalizing problems compared to a nondirective intervention in a clinical sample. A sample of 110 parents of children with externalizing disorders (80 % boys) were randomized to either a behaviorally oriented or a nondirective guided self-help program. Four putative mediating variables were examined simultaneously in a multiple mediation model using structural equation modelling. The outcomes were child symptoms of ADHD and ODD as well as child externalizing problems, assessed at posttreatment. Analyses showed a significant indirect effect for dysfunctional parental attributions in favor of the group receiving the behavioral program, and significant effects of the behavioral program on positive and negative parenting and parental self-efficacy, compared to the nondirective intervention. Our results indicate that a decrease of dysfunctional parental attributions leads to a decrease of child externalizing problems when parents take part in a behaviorally oriented guided self-help program. However, none of the putative mediating variables could explain the decrease in child externalizing behavior problems in the nondirective group. A change in dysfunctional parental attributions should be considered as a possible mediator in the context of PT.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 R&D productivity; Drug discovery; Basic and applied research; Science-technology linkages; Pharmaceuticals; Biotechnology        	Breakthroughs in genetics and molecular biology in the 1970s and 1980s were heralded as a major technological revolution in medicine that would yield a wave of new drug discoveries. However, some forty years later the expected benefits have not materialized. I question the narrative of biotechnology as a Schumpeterian revolution by comparing it to the academic research paradigm that preceded it, clinical research in hospitals. I analyze these as distinct research paradigms that involve different epistemologies, practices, and institutional loci. I develop the claim that the complexity of biological systems means that clinical research was well adapted to medical innovation, and that the genetics/molecular biology paradigm imposed a predictive logic to search that was less effective at finding new drugs. The paper describes how drug discovery unfolds in each paradigm: in clinical research, discovery originates with observations of human subjects and proceeds through feedback-based learning, whereas in the genetics model,discovery originates with a precisely-defined molecular target; feedback from patients enters late in the process. The paper reviews the post-War institutional history that witnessed the relative decline of clinical research and the rise of genetics and molecular science in the United States bio-medical research landscape. The history provides a contextual narrative to illustrate that, in contrast to the framing of biotechnology as a Schumpeterian revolution, the adoption of biotechnology as a core drug discovery platform was propelled by institutional changes that were largely disconnected from processes of scientific or technological selection. Implications for current medical policy initiatives and translational science are discussed. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 Leidenfrost effect; Phase change; Direct numerical simulation; Evaporation; Boiling; Two-phase flow; Level Set method; Ghost fluid method        	In this paper, we compare numerical simulations and experiments on droplets impinging onto a hot surface at a temperature well above the Leidenfrost point, for different impacting Weber numbers ranging from 7 to 45. We use a novel numerical method for the simulation of two-phase flows with phase change (evaporation and boiling) which accounts for the heterogeneous thermodynamic conditions at the liquid/gas interface. We present the results of experimental and numerical values for the droplet shape, its spreading diameter and its loss of momentum. The numerical simulations determine the time evolution of the average vapor layer thickness, which is typically from one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the initial droplet diameter. Thermal transfer between the liquid and the gas phases are also investigated both numerically and experimentally. In the numerical results, like in the experiments, the droplet heating increases with the impacting Weber numbers. The fully resolved direct numerical simulations allow for the accurate description of the multi-scale complex problem involving both fluid mechanics and coupled heat and mass transfer.

Apelin is an endogenous ligand, involved in energy storage and metabolism which improves cardiac contractility. This study was done to evaluate the effects of apelin, L-Thyroxin (T4) or a combination of both, on cardiac function and mRNA expression of two contractile proteins, alpha and beta myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC and beta-mHC), in 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroid rats. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into five groups: Ctrl (Control), and 4 hypothyroid groups (H, HA, HT, and HAT). The Hypothyroid (H) group received 0.05% PTU in the drinking water for six weeks; the next 3 groups, along with PTU, received apelin (HA, 200 mu g/kg/day, ip), T4 (HT, 20 mu g/kg/day, gavage), or a combination of both drugs (HAT) for the last 2 weeks (weeks 5 and 6). TSH and T4 were measured using ELISA kit Isolated hearts of animals were perfused in Langendorff apparatus and left ventricular developed pressure, cardiac contractility, heart rate, rate pressure product and perfusion pressure were assessed using PowerLab ADInstruments. In addition alpha-MHC and beta-MHC mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR method in heart tissue. Apelin alone or accompanied by T4 significantly increased cardiac contractility and performance as compared to hypothyroid group. Apelin also significantly increased the alpha-MHC mRNA expression and in the presence of T4 significantly decreased beta-MHC mRNA expression. It seems that apelin alone may improve cardiac function in hypothyroid rats via genomic pathways. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The course content focuses on niche areas in component design including alternative materials. Each topic is presented in relation to a particular application. Formal lectures are combined with a case study and materials selection projects to deepen the students' knowledge and understanding of the topic. The most innovative aspect of this course curriculum has been the case study approach where the properties of materials are discussed in the context of particular applications. This approach enables the students to construct their own materials knowledge and to develop an intrinsic motivation to learn the subject material. The course has been running for more than four years, with very positive student feedback.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 Micrometry; Leydig cells; seminiferous epithelium; prenatal development; goat        	There is a definite pattern of the growth of seminiferous tubules at different post natal ages in mammals. The present work involves recording the changes of the seminiferous tubules, the cellular components of the seminiferous epithelium and the Leydig cells in male Assam goats. Different micrometrical parameters of the seminiferous tubules were found to increase with the increase in age of the male goats and they showed a significant (P < .05) increase between the age of 6 and 8 months. Also, the micrometrical parameters of different spermatogenic cells showed a significant (P < .05) increase between 6- and 8-month-old goats. The Leydig cells could be marked in the intertubular tissue right from birth. Various micrometrical parameters of the Leydig cells were found to increase with the advancement of age of the male goats. The nuclear diameter of the Leydig cells did not show a definite pattern during their postnatal growth. The other micrometrical measurements of the Leydig cells denoted their highest values at the age of 8 months.
0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 Distributed computing; Publish-subscribe; Electric vehicles; Optimization        	This paper explores advantages that a publish/subscribe middleware can offer for the implementation of an efficient and reliable electric vehicle (EV) charging control infrastructure. We propose distributed optimization publish and subscribe (DOPS), a framework for distributed optimization of EV charging, which works on top of a pub/sub middleware and extends it to support in-network aggregation. For our evaluation, we deployed DOPS in a testbed consisting of 15 virtual machines connected via a VLAN network and compared three different communication schemes: centralized, decentralized and decentralized with aggregation. Our results show that for up to 120 EVs a centralized approach is faster. However, the trends reveal that for more than 150 EVs a decentralized approaches will offer better performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that the in-network aggregation feature of DOPS doubles the performance of the decentralized approach. Our results thus confirm that distributed control infrastructures can benefit from using pub/sub middleware.
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 construal level theory; delay-of-gratification; linguistic categorization model; self-control        	Research indicates that inducing high-level construal (processing that highlights invariant, essential features) relative to low-level construal (processing that highlights idiosyncratic, peripheral features) promotes self-control (Fujita & Carnevale, 2012). In the present work, we investigate to what extent people recognize the self-control benefits of high-level construal, and explore the consequences of this knowledge. Studies 1 and 2 provide initial evidence that individuals are aware that high-level relative to low-level construal promotes self-control in the dieting domain. Studies 3 and 4 find that individual differences in this knowledge predict self-control success outcomes (i.e., body mass index) among those who are motivated by dieting goals. Examining academics as a domain of self-control, Study 5 demonstrates that those with higher knowledge of construal level's impact on self-control earned higher end-of-semester grades to the extent that they were motivated to do well academically. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 Aged; Liver Regeneration; Proliferation; Apoptosis        	Objective: Patients over 60 years of age have higher mortality and morbidity after major liver resections. Nitric oxide (NO) derived from the catalytic activity of Nos2 plays a beneficial role in liver regeneration (LR) after partial hepatectomy (PH). In this experiment, we evaluated the effect of Nos2 knockout (KO) on LR in aged mice after PH. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 52 two-year-old Nos2 KO and 46 the same age wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 2/3 PH. Liver tissues were collected at 11 time points after PH. Mice survival ratio and liver coefficient (liver-weight/ body-weight) was calculated. Transcript and protein levels were estimated by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. Results: The aged Nos2 KO mice had lower survival ratio (P=0.039) and liver coefficient (P=0.002) at the termination phase. Nos2 transcript level was obviously increased after PH in WT mice and undetected in the Nos2 KO mice. During LR, the expression at the transcript level of Cyclin D1, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 and protein expression level of proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferation-associated transcription factors JNK1, NF-kB and STAT3 were decreased or delayed. The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, CAS-PASE3, CASPASE9 and BAX, was increased in the Nos2 KO mice. Conclusion: Decreased survival ratio and impaired LR in aged Nos2 KO mice is probably due to decreased liver cell proliferation and increased liver cell apoptosis.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Fine-grained image recognition; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Bag-of-visual-words; Feature weighting; Dimension reduction        	Fine-grained image recognition, a computer vision task filled with challenges due to its imperceptible inter-class variance and large intra-class variance, has been drawing increasing attention. While manual annotation can be utilized to effectively enhance performance in this task, it is extremely time-consuming and expensive. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. We propose a fine-grained image recognition framework by exploiting CNN as the raw feature extractor along with several effective methods including a feature encoding method, a feature weighting method, and a strategy to better incorporate information from multi-scale images to further improve recognition ability. Besides, we investigate two dimension reduction methods and successfully merge them to our framework to compact the final image representation. Based on the discriminative and compact framework, we achieved the state-of-the-art performance in terms of classification accuracy on several fine-grained image recognition benchmarks based on weekly supervision.
6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 liquid water; force matching; ab initio; molecular dynamics; Monte Carlo        	The accuracy of water models derived from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations by means on an improved force-matching scheme is assessed for various thermodynamic, transport, and structural properties. It is found that although the resulting force-matched water models are typically less accurate than fully empirical force fields in predicting thermodynamic properties, they are nevertheless much more accurate than generally appreciated in reproducing the structure of liquid water and in fact superseding most of the commonly used empirical water models. This development demonstrates the feasibility to routinely parametrize computationally efficient yet predictive potential energy functions based on accurate ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for a large variety of different systems.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Vitamin D; Cardiovascular system; Metabolic networks and pathways        	Vitamin D is a molecule that is actively involved in multiple metabolic pathways. It is mostly known for its implications related to calcium metabolism. It has also been determined that it actively participates in the cardiovascular system, influencing blood pressure, coronary artery disease and other vascular diseases, such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, it has been established that this vitamin is extensively involved in the regulation of both the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and the immune system. In this review, we present the different vitamin D metabolic pathways associated with the cardiovascular pathophysiology, and we include studies in animal and human models, as well as some of the controversies found in the literature. This review also incorporates an overview of the implications in the molecular biology and public health fields.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Lead market; Dominant innovation design; Innovation; International diffusion; Principal component analysis        	This paper examines the conditions of global dominant innovation design considering e-mobility and the emergence of the lead market in different countries. The development of lead markets is linked to multiple, country-specific factors, which influence the lead market potential and position through the decreasing of national differences over time by benefits of the best compromise of an internationally similar innovation design. Due an early market entry, firms can reach first mover advantages, which they have to protect against followers. Especially eco-innovations could reach a state of a global dominant design, because they are developed to tackle the climate change. The development of globally sold e-mobility products, e.g. the electric motor, the battery or the whole vehicle is more likely. Therefore, the strategy to strengthen a lead market for e-mobility seems to be promising. With the help of a principal component analysis (PCA), different country-specific indicators were applied in the model of five lead market factors. But lead markets change quickly and the given theoretical concept is only estimating opportunities and not forecasting technology developments. After the evaluation the USA obtain the 1st lead market position according to e-mobility, followed by Germany and France. The advantage of the USA is mainly a result of demand incentives and a large sales market. In Germany supply side indicators are more pronounced. The position of France mainly results from well advanced supply and demand side measures in average.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Compressed air; Microturbine; Bleed air; Life-cycle cost analysis; Compressed air generation        	Compressed air is an irreplaceable energy source for some manufacturing processes, and is also common in applications even when there are alternatives. As a result, compressed air is a key utility in manufacturing industry, but unfortunately the cost of compressed air production is one of the most expensive processes in a manufacturing facility. In order to reduce the compressed air generation cost an unconventional way using a microturbine configuration is proposed. The concept is based on an extraction of a certain amount of compressed air from/after the compressor with the residual air flowing to the turbine to produce sufficient back power to drive the compressor. A thermodynamic and life cycle analysis are presented for several system variations, including a simple cycle without a recuperator and a complex configuration with an intercooler, recuperator and reheating. The study is based on the typical requirements (i.e. quantity, pressure) for a small to medium sized industrial compressed air system. The analysis is focused on the North American market due to the low price of natural gas. The lowest life cycle cost alternative is represented by a microturbine concept with a recuperator, air extraction after partial compression, intercooler and aftercooler. A comparison of an electric motor and conventional microturbine prime movers demonstrates the economic benefit of the proposed compressed air generation method, for the design parameters and utility prices considered.

The filter only consists of current mirrors differentiators and capacitors. The topology is really simple, the sensitivity is very low, so it suits full integration. The computer simulation of transistor is carried out and the results show that the proposed circuits are effective.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Great Patriotic War; defense of Leningrad; Operation Barbarossa; Generalplan Ost        	The authors of this article respond to V.A. Nekhamkin's call to answer the counterfactual challenge of the past related to the question of surrendering Leningrad in the course of the Great Patriotic War. Refuting numerous pseudoscientific investigations of revisionists of the history of that war, the authors show the misanthropic essence of the Third Reich's plans with respect to the Soviet Union in general and Leningrad in particular and, using the logic of alternative history, analyze, first, possible actions of the military-political leadership of Nazi Germany in a situation similar to the blockade of Leningrad and, second, possible military consequences of the loss of the city on the Neva River. From the point of view of military science and humanitarian considerations, it is proved that the actions of the Soviet command in defending Leningrad were not only right but also that no alternative existed.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 vehicle-to-vehicle communications; tracking error; beacon rate control        	Tracking accuracy plays a critical role in V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle communications) based active safety applications. This paper proposed a beacon rate control algorithm to reduce the tracking error. By analyzing the vehicle trajectory tracking process, it is found that the tracking error is proportional to the moving status of a vehicle, as well as the data delay. Due to the constraint of the wireless communication capacity, the data delay for all the nodes can't be shortened infinitely. The principle of the algorithm design is to shorten the data delay by increasing the beacon rate for vehicles with higher dynamics, due to the reason that these vehicles are prone to cause larger tracking error with the same data delay. Simulation results show that by using the proposed algorithm, the beacon rate of the subject vehicle can adapt to the vehicle dynamics, thus in this way, the tracking error is controlled at a decimeter level.
5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 replication; conformations; free energy landscape        	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health concern for which there is no vaccine available. The HCV polymerase is responsible for the critical function of replicating the RNA genome of the virus. Transitions between at least two conformations (open and closed) are necessary to allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. In this study, molecular dynamic simulations were initiated from multiple crystal structures to understand the free energy landscape (FEL) explored by the enzyme as it interconverts between these conformations. Our studies reveal the location of distinct states within the FEL as well as the molecular interactions associated with these states. Specific hydrogen bonds appear to play a key role in modulating conformational transitions. This knowledge is essential to elucidate the role of these conformations in replication and may also be valuable in understanding the basis by which this enzyme is inhibited by small molecules.

5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 Allergy; Asthma; Eczema; Food intolerance; Prevalence        	Aim: This study investigated whether allergies among schoolchildren increased in Sweden between 1979 and 2007 and whether the geographical differences observed in previous studies remained. Methods: We collected questionnaire data on asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and eczema in children aged seven to eight years from Molndal, Gothenburg, in south-western Sweden and Kiruna in northern Sweden in 1979 (n = 4682), 1991 (n = 2481) and 2007 (n = 1029). The same regions and questions were used in all three studies, and extra questions on food allergy or intolerance were added in 2007. Results: In 1979, 1991 and 2007, the total prevalence of asthma was 2.5%, 5.7% and 7.1%, ARC was 5.5%, 8.1% and 11.1% and eczema was 7.1%, 18.3% and 19.7%, respectively. Asthma prevalence remained higher in Kiruna, but no significant regional differences were seen for ARC and eczema. Almost 20% reported a history of food allergy or intolerance, with a higher prevalence in Kiruna. The allergy risk was reduced if both parents were born outside Sweden. Conclusion: The prevalence of ARC continued to increase between 1991 and 2007, but increases in asthma and eczema started to level off in 1991. Some geographical differences remained, but total allergy rates were similar in Kiruna and Molndal in 2007.

5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 biopolymers; block copolymers; drug delivery; peptides; responsive polymers        	A series of pH/redox dual stimuli-responsive poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine)(25)-block-poly(l-histidine)(n) (p[MPC])(25)-b-p[His](n), n=20, 35, 50, and 75) copolymers consisting of a pH-responsive p(His)(n) block and a biocompatible phospholipid analog p(MPC) block connected by a redox-responsive disulfide linker have been synthesized. The block copolymers are self-assembled into uniform micelles (approximate to 100 nm) in which doxorubicin (Dox) is efficiently encapsulated. The in vitro release profile shows an enhanced release of Dox at low pH (5.0) in 10 mM glutathione (GSH). The in vitro cell viability assays performed using various cell lines show that the blank hybrid micelles have no acute or intrinsic toxicity. A pH-dependent cytotoxicity is observed with the Dox-loaded micelles, especially at pH 5.0. Moreover, confocal microscopy images and flow cytometry results show the pH-dependent cellular uptake of Dox-loaded micelles. Therefore, the Dox-loaded micelles can be considered a good candidate for cancer therapy. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem. 2017, 55, 2061-2070
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 Anonymity; TSP; divide-and-conquer; Gray sort; privacy preserving data mining        	Several approaches have been proposed to anonymize relational databases using the criterion of k-anonymity, to avoid the disclosure of sensitive information by re-identification attacks. A relational database is said to meet the criterion of k-anonymity if each record is identical to at least (k - 1) other records in terms of quasi-identifier attribute values. To anonymize a transactional database and satisfy the constraint of k-anonymity, each item must successively be considered as a quasi-identifier attribute. But this process greatly increases dimensionality, and thus also the computational complexity of anonymization, and information loss. In this paper, a novel efficient anonymization system called PTA is proposed to not only anonymize transactional data with a small information loss but also to reduce the computational complexity of the anonymization process. The PTA system consists of three modules, which are the Pre-processing module, the TSP module, and the Anonymity model, to anonymize transactional data and guarantees that at least k-anonymity is achieved: a pre-processing module, a traveling salesman problem module, and an anonymization module. Extensive experiments have been carried to compare the efficiency of the designed approach with the state-of-the-art anonymization algorithms in terms of scalability, runtime, and information loss. Results indicate that the proposed PTA system outperforms the compared algorithms in all respects.
5	3	75	Medical 	 Ankylosing Spondylitis  	 Multiple sclerosis; Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor; Meta-analysis        	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease in which we can recognize destruction of the myelin that is around nerve cells of brain and spinal cord called as oligodendrocytes. Both genetic and environmental factors play roles in MS. One of these genes is the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) which expressed on surface of natural killer cells (NKs). These genes have loci (not locus) in human genome, so they inherit as haplotypes. The results of previous studies show that different genes of KIR may affect both susceptibility and resistance to such autoimmune disorders that their pathogenesis in MS is still unclear. Since NKs play key roles in immune tolerance, we intend to perform a meta-analysis for the correlation of KIR genes and MS. We used the software comprehensive meta-analysis for data of totally 568 MS patients and 280 controls. Among the 14 genes of KIR in the human genome, lack of KIR2DS1 is accompanied by MS. No KIR gene found to be a risk factor for MS. Further studies on other molecules of NKs like CD94 and NKG2a is suggested. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 Water hydraulics; Piston pump; Port valve; Noise; Submersible        	Open-circle sea water hydraulics, utilizing surrounding water as a working medium, has become more and more popular in submersible. Axial piston pump with port valves is used frequently in the open-circle water hydraulic system. Port valve is one of the important parts in this type pump. However, there are few literatures about the effect of the port valves' materials on the noise characteristic of the water pump. In this study, the effect of materials on the noise of the pump was researched through experimental and theory simulation methods. The influences of three kinds of plastics (Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Aliphatic polyamides (NYLON)) and one kind of anti-corrosion stainless steel (316 L) are colimared. The noise of the pump with the different materials port valve seat ranges from high to low as the order: 316 L >NYLON >PEEK >PTFE. The differences would contribute to the collision between valve spool and seat, which is identified by the simulating results. The experimental results showed that the difference of noise between PEEK and PTFE is small. In addition, the lifespan and volumetric efficiency are also taken into considering. The PEEK is selected to use in the seawater pump for a large submersible.
3	2	54	MAE 	 Manufacturing engineering  	 Mechanism design; High Precision Clamping; Freeform Bodies; Milling        	In manufacturing engineering, especially in machining process, the definition of a reference plane is the first essential step within the overall process. After the reference plane is applied at the component all other features are processed with reference to this basic plane. During any process the component has to be clamped in order to resist the processing forces. There are several clamping systems available, such as pneumatic, magnetic systems or magneto-rheological (MR) systems. Depending on its stiffness the component is deformed due to the clamping forces, stresses are introduced. This effect can be neglected for components with a high stiffness and nearly rigid body behaviour. However, the deformation of low stiff components under clamping forces, e.g. sheet metals, is relatively large and is in the same range as the addressed accuracy of machining process. Due to the introduced elastic clamping stresses the component will reconfigure after clamping, this phenomenon is known as springback. The focus of this work is the design of a clamping system for flexible bodies in order to reduce the springback and to enable high precision processing. This clamping system consists in a set of supports, which adjust to the surface of the body without introducing stresses and causing no springback after the machining process. The number and the arrangement of the supports are optimized as a function of the intensity and position of the milling force and the geometrical and mechanical properties of the body as well. The functional unit of the clamping system is a cylindrical bodysliding nearly frictionless within a pipe. Numerical simulation is used for configuration and optimization. The developed clamping systems can also be used to process freeform shaped bodies.

0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 Learning Spaces; Exhibition Rooms; Cultural Heritage; Ontology; Domain Specific Language        	A good virtual Learning Space (LS) should convey pertinent learning information to the visitors at the most adequate time and locations to favor their knowledge acquisition. Considering the consolidation of the internet and the improvement of the interaction, searching, and learning mechanisms, we propose a generic architecture, called CaVa, to create virtual Learning Spaces building up on cultural institution documents. More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 net-positive; built environment; sustainable buildings; sustainability indicators; sustainability; neighbourhood; building assessment systems; sustainability criteria        	An alternative approach to conceptualizing and measuring the built environment is developed which forms the basis of a new assessment tool. The role of buildings is reframed to consider what capabilities for sustainability a building can provide to the inhabitants and local community. This capability to support sustainability is defined as the ability to improve the local quality of life (Human Development Index) whilst remaining below the environmental carrying capacity (environmental footprint). This approach has clear implications about the role of buildings in enabling residents and users to achieve these targets and outcomes. This shifts the focus of net-positive development toward configurations and characteristics of the built environment that are appropriate for a particular context. A Built Environment Sustainability Tool (BEST) is presented that defines and assesses these configurations and characteristics. Assessments can be conducted by measuring the extent to which required configurations and characteristics exist (i.e. 'the capability of the built environment to support sustainability'). BEST is compared with other green building rating tool approaches in order to review the methodology critically and to evaluate this as a means of improving built environment sustainability performance.

Theoretical determination of overall performances for this circuits is generally known. This paper presents a practical method for real output impedance determining of such current sources based on performing two simple measurements. The results is according with the measurements on the practical circuit.

6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Mitochondrial diseases; DNA polymerase gamma; Genetics; Clinical phenotypes        	POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma, essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and repair. Mutations in POLG have been linked to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, resulting in autosomal recessive or dominant mitochondrial diseases. These mutations have been associated with heterogeneous phenotypes, presenting with varying severity and at different ages of onset, ranging from the neonatal period to late adult life. We screened 13 patients for POLG mutations. All patients underwent a complete neurological examination, and in most of cases, muscle biopsy was performed. We detected 15 different variations in 13 unrelated Italian patients. Two mutations were novel and mapped in the pol domain (p.Thr989dup and p.Ala847Thr) of the enzyme. We also report new cases carrying controversial variations previously described as incompletely penetrant or a variant of unknown significance. Our study increases the range of clinical presentations associated with mutations in POLG gene, underlining some peculiar clinical features, such as PEO associated with corneal edema, and epilepsy, severe neuropathy with achalasia. The addition of two new substitutions, including the second report of an in-frame duplication, to the growing list of defects increases the value of POLG genetic diagnosis in a range of neurological presentations.
0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 Single-cell genomics; Decontamination; GUI software        	"Background: Whole genome amplification techniques have enabled the analysis of unexplored genomic information by sequencing of single-amplified genomes (SAGs). Whole genome amplification of single bacteria is currently challenging because contamination often occurs in experimental processes. Thus, to increase the confidence in the analyses of sequenced SAGs, bioinformatics approaches that identify and exclude non-target sequences from SAGs are required. Since currently reported approaches utilize sequence information in public databases, they have limitations when new strains are the targets of interest. Here, we developed a software SAG-QC that identify and exclude non-target sequences independent of database. Results: In our method, ""no template control"" sequences acquired during WGA were used. We calculated the probability that a sequence was derived from contaminants by comparing k-mer compositions with the no template control sequences. Based on the results of tests using simulated SAG datasets, the accuracy of our method for predicting non-target sequences was higher than that of currently reported techniques. Subsequently, we applied our tool to actual SAG datasets and evaluated the accuracy of the predictions. Conclusions: Our method works independently of public sequence information for distinguishing SAGs from non-target sequences. This method will be effective when employed against SAG sequences of unexplored strains and we anticipate that it will contribute to the correct interpretation of SAGs."
0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 Robotic Surgery; Preoperative setup planning; Raven-II; Robot setup simulation        	In this research we present a Preoperative Robotic Surgery Simulator platform as a means of training for Raven-II Surgical system. The simulator employs PHANTOM Omni (now Geomagic (R) Touch(TM)) as a master device to control the arms of the 3D simulated model of Raven-II in virtual environment. The earlier simulators for Raven-II were built primarily to work over Debian-based Linux Operating Systems. This is the first attempt towards development of a simulator in MATLAB which, being a cross platform application, allows the accessibility of the simulator to a broader community of surgeons and researchers. The simulator is designed to provide the haptic feedback to the user which results ina realistic emulation of surgery environment. Other key features include opening and closing of the surgical tool using pen buttons ofPHANTOMOmni and a 'freeflow' feature with which a surgeon can willingly pause the motion of surgical robot to adjust the position of input device as per the requirement. The simulator was successfully built and tested in MATLAB and the results from the simulation satisfactorily verified the efficacy of the proposed system.

The belief that race is a social construct without ""biological authenticity'' though widely shared across disciplines in social science is not subscribed to by traditional science. Yet with an interdisciplinary approach, the two horns of the social construct/genetics dilemma of race are not mutually exclusive. We can use traditional science to provide a rigorous framework and use a social-science approach so that ""invisible'' factors are used to adjust the design of studies on an as-needed basis. One approach is to first observe health-care outcomes and then categorize the outcomes, thus removing genetic differences as racial proxies from the design of the study. From the outcomes, we can then determine if there is a pattern of conceivable racial categories. If needed, we can apply dynamic notions of race to acknowledge bias without prejudice. We can use them constructively to improve outcomes and reduce racial disparities. Another approach is nearly identical but considers race not at all: While analyzing outcomes, we can determine if there are biological differences significant enough to identify classifications of humans. That is, we look for genetic patterns in the outcomes and classify only those patterns. There is no attempt to link those patterns to race."

Yet some children thrive or ""adapt well"" despite experiencing abuse; researchers are increasingly interested in the protective factors and mechanisms that may prevent negative outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of resiliency characteristics in the relationship between childhood abuse and the negative outcomes of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, and revictimization in adolescent girls involved in child welfare. Participants were 237 adolescent girls ages 12-19 years (M = 14.9, SD = 1.6), and who were youths of color (75%) and white (25%). Data were collected through surveys assessing histories of physical, sexual, and emotional child abuse; symptoms of post traumatic stress and depression; lifetime substance use; and experiences of physical, verbal, and relational revictimization in the last three months. All forms of childhood abuse were significantly associated with symptoms of depression and PTSD as well as revictimization and substance use. Higher levels of resiliency were associated with fewer depression and PTSD symptoms and experiencing less revictimization. Resiliency significantly moderated the relationship between sexual abuse and depression, PTSD, and revictimization. Resiliency also moderated the relationship between emotional abuse and depression. No significant interactions emerged in the relationship between physical abuse and any of the mental health and behavioral problems. This study suggests that resiliency may serve as a protective factor in the relationship between abuse (sexual and emotional) and depression, PTSD, and revictimization during adolescence.

2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 first-person perception; optimistic bias; media effects; nature change; impersonal risk        	"Many changes in nature do not directly threaten humans, but do negatively influence nature itself, thereby posing an ""impersonal"" risk. We examine the optimistic bias (OB) for an impersonal risk, the first-person perception (FPP) of an impersonal risk, and the influence of media reporting and proximity of an impersonal risk on FPP and OB. Finally, we investigate the relationship between OB and FPP. We conducted a field experiment (N = 479) in 12 German cities where an invasive moth species had infested culturally important horse chestnut trees. We found OB for this nature change that decreased for people living in an area subject to this impersonal nature risk. After the treatments, neither the proximity of impersonal risk nor the journalistic style of media reporting had a significant effect on OB. An FPP was found that was not influenced significantly by either different journalistic styles or the proximity of impersonal risk. A nonsignificant swap-in-signs relation between OB and FPP was found depending on journalistic style."
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 concussion; mild traumatic brain injury; children; pediatrics; postconcussion symptoms; delayed recovery; slow to recover        	Objective: To identify predictors of delayed recovery in children who sustained a concussion and sought care in a pediatric hospital. Design: Retrospective cohort study design. Setting: Montreal Children's Hospital Concussion Clinic database. Patients: Children who sustained a concussion and sought care within 10 days of the injury, with complete medical history and Postconcussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) score available. Independent Variables: Total symptom score on the PCSS, sex, age, history of concussion, sleep disturbances, anxiety, learning disabilities, attention problems, and depression. Main Outcome Measure: Delayed recovery (28 days or more). Results: A total of 213 children (F = 76, M = 138) with a mean age of 13.89 +/- 2.55 years were included. Only total PCSS score at 10 days postinjury was identified as a significant predictor of delayed recovery (odds ratio: 1.019, P = 0.01). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential for clinicians to identify, with the sole use of the PCSS, children at risk of experiencing symptoms for longer periods of time.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Single-phase electric power  	 Artificial neural networks; harmonic identification; power quality; single-phase power system        	In this paper, an alternative method based on artificial neural networks is presented for the determination of load current harmonic components in a single-phase electric power system. The first six harmonic components are calculated from current waveforms of an AC controller and a single-phase diode bridge rectifier, which are the most common loads in industrial, commercial and residential applications. The influences of such nonlinear loads in power quality issues are also characterized. The proposed method is compared with truncated FFT. Simulation and experimental results are presented in order to validate the proposed approach.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 GPR30; inflammatory bowel diseases; Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; biological therapy        	Background & Aims: G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) is a recently de-orphanized estrogen receptor that mediates the effects of estrogens on different cells. It has been postulated that in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) activation of GPR30 blocks the pathways dependent on pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of our study was to investigate GPR30 expression in patients with IBD and its potential implication in future therapies. Methods. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled in our study: 20 subjects with Crohn's disease (CD), 22 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 15 controls. In each subject, biopsies were taken from various left-colonic locations. Gene and protein expression of GPR30 was quantified using real time RT-PCR or Western blot. Results: GPR30 mRNA and protein expression were detected in all tested colonic tissues. No significant differences in GPR30 gene expression were observed. In non-inflamed areas, GPR30 protein was strongly increased in CD patients, but moderately in UC patients (p = 0.014 and p = 0.143, respectively, vs. controls). In CD patients, a significantly lower GPR30 protein content in inflamed than in non-inflamed tissue was observed (p= 0.039). The change was independent of patient gender. Conclusion: Our observations indicate that GPR30 may play a role in the development and progression of inflammatory lesions in IBD, thus affecting disease severity, and consequently IBD treatment. Therefore, GPR30 may become an attractive target for novel anti-IBD drugs, particularly in CD.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Bioinformatics; microRNA; identification; eucheuma denticulatum; high-throughput sequencing; characterization        	Eucheuma denticulatum, an economically and industrially important red alga, is a valuable marine resource. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene post-transcriptional regulation, no research has been conducted to identify and characterize miRNAs in E. denticulatum. In this study, we identified 134 miRNAs (133 conserved miRNAs and one novel miRNA) from 2,997,135 small-RNA reads by high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatics analysis. BLAST searching against miRBase uncovered 126 potential miRNA families. A conservation and diversity analysis of predicted miRNA families in different plant species was performed by comparative alignment and homology searching. A total of 4 and 13 randomly selected miRNAs were respectively validated by northern blotting and stem-loop reverse transcription PCR, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the miRNA sequencing data. Altogether, 871 potential target genes were predicted using psRobot and TargetFinder. Target genes classification and enrichment were conducted based on Gene Ontology analysis. The functions of target gene products and associated metabolic pathways were predicted by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis. A Cytoscape network was constructed to explore the interrelationships of miRNAs, miRNA-target genes and target genes. A large number of miRNAs with diverse target genes will play important roles for further understanding some essential biological processes in E. denticulatum. The uncovered information can serve as an important reference for the protection and utilization of this unique red alga in the future.

Although unchanged AB-CHMINACA could be detected from 8 solid tissues, it could neither be detected from blood nor urine specimens. In this article, we obtained eight kinds of reference standards of AB-CHMINACA metabolites from a commercial source. The AB-CHMINACA metabolites from the urine specimen of the abuser were extracted by a modified QuEChERS method and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry before and after hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase. Among the eight AB-CHMINACA metabolites tested, only 2 metabolites could be identified in the urine specimen of the deceased. After hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, the concentrations of the two metabolites were not increased, suggesting that the metabolites were not in the conjugated forms. The metabolites detected were 4-hydroxycyclohexylmethyl AB-CHMINACA (M1), followed by N-[[1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]carbonyl]-L-valine (M3). Their concentrations were 52.8 +/- 3.44 and 41.3 +/- 5.04 ng/ml (n = 10) for M1 and M3, respectively. Although there is one preceding report showing the estimations of metabolism of AB-CHMINACA without reference standards, this is the first report dealing with exact identification using reference standards, and quantification of M1 and M3 in an authentic urine specimen.

5	28	100	Medical 	 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  	 Rheumatology; Usual interstitial pneumonia; Mycophenolate mofetil; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Interstitial lung disease; Connective tissue disease        	Background: Azathioprine is a commonly prescribed therapy for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD). Combination therapy that included azathioprine was recently shown to increase the risk of death and hospitalization in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Whether azathioprine increases the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with fibrotic CTD-ILD, including those with CTD-associated usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), remains unknown. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed to determine the combined incidence rate of death, transplant and respiratory hospitalization associated with azathioprine exposure. A fibrotic CTD-ILD cohort treated with mycophenolate mofetil served as a comparator group. Incidence rates were compared with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) generated by negative binomial regression. Longitudinal pulmonary function response was then assessed using mixed effects linear regression models. Results: Fifty-four patients were treated with azathioprine and forty-three with mycophenolate. Medication discontinuation due to non-respiratory side effects occurred in 27% and 5% of the azathioprine and mycophenolate cohorts, respectively. The combined incidence rate of adverse outcomes was 0.015 and 0.013 for azathioprine and mycophenolate, respectively (IRR 1.23; 95% CI 0.49-3.12; p = 0.66). Similar incidence rates were observed among those with CTD-UIP (IRR 0.83; 95% CI 0.21-3.31; p = 0.79). Both groups demonstrated pulmonary function stability over time, with the azathioprine group demonstrating a marginal improvement. Conclusions: A significant minority of patients could not tolerate azathioprine due to non-respiratory side effects. Of those who did tolerate azathioprine, a similar incidence of adverse outcomes was observed as those treated with mycophenolate. Both therapies were associated with stability in pulmonary function.

2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 women's activism; transversal politics; women's advocacy and representation        	In this response which is generally sympathetic and agrees with many of Aili Tripp's points, I raise a couple of issues which divert or are somewhat different from hers. For example, unlike the way in which Tripp's essay emphasizes geographical/cultural differences as a comparative framework, I propose that it is the political aim of the particular feminist activism that acts as the primary reason why certain feminist political projects emphasize similarity and others differences among women. I also discuss in this respect transversal politics, in which women (and other groupings) cooperate across borders and boundaries, recognizing their different social locations and identifications, but sharing their common feminist and emancipatory political perspectives, working through a dialogical epistemology. In transversal politics the activists, however, should not see themselves as representing all women or even all women from their collectivity but rather as their advocates. When this is not the case, there is a danger of essentialist construction of womanhood and gender roles. This is why measures, like the UN 1325 resolution that calls for the increase of the number of women as women' participants in peace negotiations to be mandatory, can be a double- edge sword, as not all women should be seen as promoters of peace.
3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 Electric machine; high-speed; inverter; machine design; silicon-carbide        	The purpose of this paper is to investigate high-speed machine design enabled through the use of silicon-carbide based power electronic inverters. Silicon carbide based switching devices have superior properties compared to silicon based devices, and they are able to change the paradigm for high-speed machine design. High-speed machines with a higher number of poles are shown to reduce the machine weight and volume compared to low-pole number machines. Silicon carbide inverters can readily provide the high fundamental frequency requirement of high-pole number machines due to its MOSFET characteristics. From a system level optimization perspective, research results presented in this paper indicate that control laws that optimize the high-speed machine can be given higher priorities than designs that optimize the inverter, because the penalties of oversizing and loss aspects from the inverter are much less prominent by using silicon carbide devices than silicon devices.

Many combinatorial objects are closely related to EDFs, such as difference sets, difference families, almost difference sets, and difference systems of sets. Constructing EDFs is thus of significance in theory and practice. In this paper, earlier ideas of constructing EDFs proposed by Chang and Ding (2006), and Huang and Wu (2009), are further explored. Consequently, new infinite classes of EDFs are obtained and some previously known results are extended. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 Reticulum; Omasum; Immuno-histochemistry; Ki-67; aSMA; Vimentin; Baladi goat        	Seven Baladi goats of both sexes (9 to 24 months old) were used to describe the distribution pattern of ki-67, alpha smooth muscle actin (aSMA) and vimentin (VIM) in the reticulum and omasum. This study was carried out using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method. Ki-67 immunostaining was restricted to the basal cells layer in the epithelia of both the reticulum and omasum, suggesting the importance of ki-67 in epithelial cells proliferation and keratin biosynthesis. Immunostaining for aSMA was detected in smooth muscle cells in reticular folds, omasal lamiae and muscularis in both the reticulum and omasum, indicating the critical role of aSMA in muscular motility. The widespread distribution of VIM immunostainings in epithelia, fibroblasts in lamina propria and submucosa, and endothelia of blood vessels supports the importance of VIM as an intermediate filament protein. Detection of VIM in glial cells of enteric plexuses indicates its supportive role in the nervous control of both reticulum and omasum. Overall, this immunohistochemical study revealed non-significant differences in the expression of ki-67, aSMA, and VIM between the reticulum and omasum. This study thus verifies the important roles of ki-67, aSMA and VIM in the structure and function of the reticulum and omasum of Baladi goats.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 Rainfall; Runoff; Water quality; Water supply; Virginia; Rainwater harvesting; Model; Reliability; Runoff capture; Water quality; Water supply        	Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a decentralized practice that provides both water supply and runoff reduction benefits that are often difficult to assess. To assist in this evaluation, a model was developed that simulates a single RWH system in Richmond, Virginia, using storage volume, roof area, irrigated area, an indoor nonpotable demand, and a storage dewatering goal as independent design variables. Water supply and runoff capture reliability are assessed for a wide variety of cases. Tradeoff curves were developed to evaluate the design variable substitution when reliability was held constant. A reliability function was fit to the simulation results, and a solution method was developed to solve for an unknown variable as a function of the others. This method evaluates different design cases that provide the same water supply and/or runoff reliability, demonstrating that the design variables can be substituted for each other, using care to restrict substitutions between functional inputs or (separately) functional outputs. This method can provide guidance for designers in selecting equivalent RWH systems and regulators in assessing runoff reduction goals. Results indicate that the dewatering goal enhances runoff capture reliability but reduces water supply reliability moderately. Increases in storage volume increased both water supply and runoff capture reliability. Irrigated area has a much larger, negative effect on water supply reliability, and roof area has a similar negative effect on runoff capture reliability. As irrigated area increases for the same population, runoff capture reliability increases but eventually remains constant, reflecting the dominance of indoor demand, which in turn reflects the simulation's assumption of seasonal irrigation. Applications indicate that land uses that provide larger demands, such as offices, commercial sites, and high-density residential sites, may be better suited than lower-density residential lots where RWH is more commonly employed.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 protein interactions; signaling pathways; cell communication; optogenetics; gene editing; synthetic biology; gene expression regulation; controlling behavior        	In biological systems, the formation of molecular complexes is the currency for all cellular processes. Traditionally, functional experimentation was targeted to single molecular players in order to understand its effects in a cell or animal phenotype. In the last few years, we have been experiencing rapid progress in the development of ground-breaking molecular biology tools that affect the metabolic, structural, morphological, and (epi) genetic instructions of cells by chemical, optical (optogenetic) and mechanical inputs. Such precise dissection of cellular processes is not only essential for a better understanding of biological systems, but will also allow us to better diagnose and fix common dysfunctions. Here, we present several of these emerging and innovative techniques by providing the reader with elegant examples on how these tools have been implemented in cells, and, in some cases, organisms, to unravel molecular processes in minute detail. We also discuss their advantages and disadvantages with particular focus on their translation to multicellular organisms for in vivo spatiotemporal regulation. We envision that further developments of these tools will not only help solve the processes of life, but will give rise to novel clinical and industrial applications.

These pathogens encode a variety of non-coding RNAs, which are important cofactors for oncogenesis. In this review, we focus on recent developments in the study of long and small non-protein-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, of oncogenic pathogens, and discuss their mechanisms of action in the multiple steps of oncogenesis.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Monte Carlo simulation; Parallel computing; Calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; Post-breakdown laser induced plasma; Quatemary oxides        	The improved Monte-Carlo (MC) method for standard-less analysis in laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is presented. Concentrations in MC LIBS are found by fitting model-generated synthetic spectra to experimental spectra. The current version of MC LIBS is based on the graphic processing unit (GPU) computation and reduces the analysis time down to several seconds per spectrum/sample. The previous version of MC LIBS which was based on the central processing unit (CPU) computation requested unacceptably long analysis times of 10's minutes per spectrum/sample. The reduction of the computational time is achieved through the massively parallel computing on the GPU which embeds thousands of co-processors. It is shown that the number of iterations on the GPU exceeds that on the CPU by a factor >1000 for the 5-dimentional parameter space and yet requires >10-fold shorter computational time. The improved GPU-MC LIBS outperforms the CPU-MS LIBS in terms of accuracy, precision, and analysis time. The performance is tested on LIBS-spectra obtained from pelletized powders of metal oxides consisting of CaO, Fe2O3, MgO, and TiO2 that simulated by-products of steel industry, steel slags. It is demonstrated that GPU-based MC LIBS is capable of rapid multi-element analysis with relative error between 1 and 10's percent that is sufficient for industrial applications (e.g. steel slag analysis). The results of the improved GPU-based MC LIBS are positively compared to that of the CPU-based MC LIBS as well as to the results of the standard calibration-free (CF) LIBS based on the Boltzmann plot method.

2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 Attentional bias; Bulimia nervosa; Cognitive bias; Purging        	Previous research exploring cognitive biases in bulimia nervosa suggests that attentional biases occur for both food-related and body-related cues. Individuals with bulimia were compared to non-bulimic controls on an emotional-Stroop task which contained both food-related and body-related cues. Results indicated that bulimics (but not controls) demonstrated a cognitive bias for both food-related and body related cues. However, a discrepancy between the two cue-types was observed with body-related cognitive biases showing the most robust effects and food-related cognitive biases being the most strongly associated with the severity of the disorder. The results may have implications for clinical practice as bulimics with an increased cognitive bias for food-related cues indicated increased bulimic disorder severity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is seen as a promising alternative to the current care models so a number of researchers have developed AAL systems with promising results. The main goal of AAL solutions is to apply ambient intelligence technologies to enable people with specific needs to continue to live in their preferred environments. In this paper, we are presenting a general architecture of system for assisted living that supports most of the use cases for such system.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 professional attitudes; reproductive aspects; mental illness        	Study aims: Analysis of mental health professionals' attitudes to reproductive issues among psychiatric patients. Method: 31 problem-centered semi-structured interviews with psychiatric professionals were conducted and analyzed by content analysis methods. Results: Outside of psychotherapeutic treatment the desire for children is generally assessed as less important in the context of mental health care, it is often limited to effective birth control with regard to drug treatment. Mental health professionals perceive moral concerns, lack of expertise among professionals and individual doubts as barriers when dealing with reproductive issues. Discussion: In order to meet psychiatric patients' reproductive needs, perceptions of barriers amongmental health professionals in dealing with reproductive issues should be reflected and discussed. Recommendations could support professionals and help ensure adequate support for psychiatric patients.

The natural excitation technique (NExT) combined with the eigen realization algorithm (ERA) was applied for the output-only modal analysis. Parameters regarding the NExT and ERA procedures were determined from a sensitivity analysis of identified damping ratios. Because a multiple tuned mass damper (MTMD) was installed at the center of the main span to mitigate VIV, the modal damping ratios before and after the installation of the MTMD were also compared. Several sets of operational monitoring data that had been collected under various windy conditions were used to develop a relationship between the identified damping ratios and the corresponding VIV level of the bridge. On the basis of these findings, the performance of the bridge was enhanced regarding vibrational serviceability. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 Kickxia ramosissima; Nanorrhinum ramosissimum; Plantaginaceae; iridoids; antimicrobial activity; antiglycation activity        	Background and Aims: Kickxia ramosissima (Wall.) Janch (or Nanorrhinum ramosissimum (Wall.) Betsche is a well-known medicinal plant in Pakistan that is traditionally used in diabetic and inflammatory conditions. Because little information is available on its phytochemical composition, a range of constituents were isolated and evaluated in vitro in assays related to the traditional use. Methods: Dried whole plant material was extracted and chromatographically fractionated. Isolated constituents were evaluated in silico and in vitro in assays related to the traditional use against diabetes (inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity; inhibition of advanced glycation endproducts) and in inflammatory conditions (inhibition of AAPH induced linoleic acid peroxidation, inhibition of 15-LOX, antimicrobial activity). Results: Phytochemical analysis of the extracts and fractions led to isolation of 7 compounds, including the iridoids kickxiasine (being a new compound), mussaenosidic acid, mussaenoside and linarioside; the flavonoids pectolinarigenin and pectolinarin; and 4-hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester. The iridoids showed weak antiglycation activity. The flavonoids, however, showed interesting results as pectolinarigenin was highly active compared to pectolinarin. In the alpha-glucosidase inhibition assay, only weak activity was observed for the iridoids. However, the flavonoid pectolinarigenin showed good activity, followed by pectolinarin. In the 15-LOX experiment, moderate inhibition was recorded for most compounds, the iridoids mussaenosidic acid and mussaenoside being the most active. In the AAPH assay, weak or no inhibition was recorded for all compounds. The in silico assays for the alpha-glucosidase and 15-LOX assays confirmed the results of respective in vitro assays. Pectolinarigenin showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Plasmodium falciparum K1, and Trypanosoma cruzi, but it was not cytotoxic on a human MRC-5 cell line. Conclusion: Our findings may in part contribute to explain the traditional use of K. ramosissima.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 psychopathy; personality disorders; dissocial personality; antisocial personality disorder; callous-unemotional traits        	Personality disorders manifest themselves in stable deviations of personality traits that especially arise in negative interactions with others. Those typical dysfunctional interactions can be observed particularly in dissocial and antisocial personality disorders: adults with severe forms of personality disorders often showed specific symptoms in childhood and adolescence. Clinical researchers therefore demand a respective diagnosis of childhood and adolescent psychopathy. There is an extensive body of research on dissocial and borderline personality disorders in children and adolescents. To date the severe form of dissocial personality disorders, psychopathy, cannot be specifically classified. The transfer of this diagnosis to childhood and adolescence is crucial: based on the assumption of persistence and the risk of stigmatisation many clinicians refuse to diagnose psychopathy at a young age. On the other hand there are positive treatment outcomes that aim at symptom reduction from a very early age. The specification of dissocial personality disorders in childhood and adolescence may encourage the development of new treatments and the de-stigmatisation as well as qualify the dogged assumption of persistence of personality disorders.
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 Smoking & tobacco; Child & adolescent health; Nutrition & diet; Risk behaviors        	Background: Cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for unhealthy dieting behaviors (UDBs) in youth. The role of alternative tobacco products and UDB engagement has yet to be examined empirically despite concerning trends in use. This study aimed to examine UDB prevalence in a U.S. geographic region- specific adolescent sample and associations with a variety of tobacco use behaviors and perceptions. Methods: Weighted data from the 2013 Virginia Youth Survey were analyzed (n = 6903). UDBs assessed included past 30-day fasting, diet pill use, and vomiting/laxative use. Tobacco-related items were ever and past 30-day cigarette smoking, past 30-day smokeless tobacco and cigar use, and the perception that smokers have more friends. UDB prevalence was recoded by the number of behaviors endorsed (0, 1, and 2+). Bivariate and multinomial regression models were used to examine associations between covariates and number of UDBs endorsed by gender. Results: Overall, nearly 16% engaged in at least one UDB. Fasting was most prevalent (14.2%) followed by vomiting/laxative (7.0%) and diet pill use (6.1%). Across gender, ever cigarette smoking, past 30-day cigar use, and the perception that smokers have more friends were positively associated with UDB engagement in relative isolation as well as in combination. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of tobacco-related factors for weight control behaviors and are the first to identify an association between UDB incidence and an alternative tobacco product, cigars. This work should inform prevention efforts for tobacco use and UDBs and underscores the need to address the use of any tobacco for weight control.
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 binge-eating disorder; cognition; factor analysis; statistical; questionnaire validity; severity        	Background: Dysfunctional cognitions regarding weight and shape and their implications for self-esteem are considered core features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However, they have also been associated with the severity of binge eating disorder (BED). Therefore, they should be screened with appropriate instruments to tailor treatment to individual patient needs. The Mizes Anorectic Cognitions-Revised (MAC-R) is a self-report questionnaire that lists dysfunctional cognitions related to three hypothesized core beliefs typical of the psychopathology of eating disorders: weight and eating as the basis of approval from others; the belief that rigid self-control is fundamental to self-worth; and the rigidity of weight- and eating-regulation efforts. Objectives: The goal of the study was to confirm the factor structure and to assess the validity of the MAC-R among a sample that met full-threshold and subthreshold criteria for BED. Methods: We used data of women meeting full-threshold (n = 94) and subthreshold (n = 22) criteria for BED to conduct confirmatory factor analyses and to compute Spearman's correlations, in order to assess factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity. Results: Two models having a structure of three factors with or without a total score proved to be acceptable. The MAC-R total score was correlated with questionnaires assessing dimensions related to eating disorder psychopathology, adding to the validity of the questionnaire. Conclusion: These results were similar to those found in studies on the psychometric properties of the MAC among samples with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, encouraging the use of the MAC-R as a research or clinical tool in order to further document the core beliefs underlying BED.
5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 Climate change; Temperature variation; Diurnal temperature range; Mortality; China        	Background: Compared with cold- and heat-related health impacts, the evidence was very limited in assessing the mortality effects of temperature variation (TV) accounting for both intra-day and inter-day changes in temperature. Objective: We used a newly proposed composite indicator of intra-day and inter-day TV and evaluated TV-mortality associations in Hubei, China at the provincial level. Methods: Daily mortality and meteorological data during 2009-2012 were obtained from 12 urban and rural counties across Hubei Province in China. TV was calculated using the standard deviation of the minimum and maximum temperatures during the exposure days. A quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag non-linear model was first applied to estimate county-specific relationship between mortality and TV, adjusting for long-term trend and seasonality, mean temperature, relative humidity, public holiday, and day of the week. A meta-analysis was then conducted to pool the county-specific estimates of TV-related mortality effects. Results: A significant positive association was observed between TV and cause-specific mortality (except for respiratory mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality). The effect estimates varied by exposure days, with the highest at 0-7 days. Season-stratified analyses showed similar results, while stronger TV-mortality associations were found in warm season than in cold season. The elderly were more susceptible to 1V-related mortality effects than younger groups. Some slight differences in effect estimates were also observed in subgroups stratified by, gender, education attainment, place of death, and urban/rural areas. Conclusion: Our study strengthened the evidence that temperature variation was an independent risk factor for non accidental mortality. Some preventive and intervention strategies should be efficiently developed in response to global climate change, so as to minimize public health burden due to unstable weather patterns.

Participants studied pictures of objects, and later lied and told the truth about these and new objects once or multiple times by describing them or by denying they had seen them. Forty-eight hours later, participants were tested on their source memory. Results revealed that participants had good memory for having falsely described a never-seen object, but relatively poor memory for having falsely denied seeing a studied object. These results suggest that telling certain types of lies may make a person more likely to forget having lied. In addition, repeated truthful denials of having seen a picture paradoxically increased false memories for having seen it. Thus, telling the truth does not always prevent the possibility of memory distortion. (C) 2013 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 laser Doppler; blood flow; CMOS; imaging sensor; full field        	The first fully integrated 2D CMOS imaging sensor with on-chip signal processing for applications in laser Doppler blood flow (LDBF) imaging has been designed and tested. To obtain a space efficient design over 64 x 64 pixels means that standard processing electronics used off-chip cannot be implemented. Therefore the analog signal processing at each pixel is a tailored design for LDBF signals with balanced optimization for signal-to-noise ratio and silicon area. This custom made sensor offers key advantages over conventional sensors, viz. the analog signal processing at the pixel level carries out signal normalization; the AC amplification in combination with an anti-aliasing filter allows analog-to-digital conversion with a low number of bits; low resource implementation of the digital processor enables on-chip processing and the data bottleneck that exists between the detector and processing electronics has been overcome. The sensor demonstrates good agreement with simulation at each design stage. The measured optical performance of the sensor is demonstrated using modulated light signals and in vivo blood flow experiments. Images showing blood flow changes with arterial occlusion and an inflammatory response to a histamine skin-prick demonstrate that the sensor array is capable of detecting blood flow signals from tissue.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Muslim women; household gender roles; Australia        	Based on research conducted in Western Australia as part of a PhD thesis, this article looks at the shifting boundaries of gender roles in Australian Muslim households. It highlights the Islamic stance on the biological differences between men and women as the basis for understanding gender roles and responsibilities. It also uncovers how the ideal influences contemporary Muslim gender roles and the interplay of social and economic factors that impact upon Australian Muslim households in their acculturation in the more liberal Western setting. In order to capture the nuances of perceptions and accounts of how the participants in the research perceive providing and caring roles in the household unit, the primary research uses narrative enquiry as part of its methodology. The findings show that there is variance between the textual injunctions and contextual realties as Muslim women also become providers for the household. While this shows that there is congruence with the mainstream Australian society, it also has implications for how gender equality and economic empowerment of women are approached in a diverse society like Australia.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Image descriptors; Medical images; Computer vision; Healthcare contexts        	Clinical decisions are sometimes based on a variety of patient's information such as: age, weight or information extracted from image exams, among others. Depending on the nature of the disease or anatomy, clinicians can base their decisions on different image exams like mammographies, positron emission tomography scans or magnetic resonance images. However, the analysis of those exams is far from a trivial task. Over the years, the use of image descriptors-computational algorithms that present a summarized description of image regions-became an important tool to assist the clinician in such tasks. This paper presents an overview of the use of image descriptors in healthcare contexts, attending to different image exams. In the making of this review, we analyzed over 70 studies related to the application of image descriptors of different natures-e.g., intensity, texture, shape-in medical image analysis. Four imaging modalities are featured: mammography, PET, CT and MRI. Pathologies typically covered by these modalities are addressed: breast masses and microcalcifications in mammograms, head and neck cancer and Alzheimer's disease in the case of PET images, lung nodules regarding CTs and multiple sclerosis and brain tumors in the MRI section.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Aspergillus fumigatus; Biomarker; Immunology; Immune response        	Fungal specific CD154(+) T-cells have been described as a biomarker in invasive aspergillosis. The influence of sample storage on the detection of these cells was assessed. Six-hour delay prior to PBMC isolation is associated with an 18% decrease of cell viability and alterations of the cellular composition of the sample. This results in 87% reduction of CD154(+) A. fumigatus specific cells due to reduced assay sensitivity and increased background values in unstimulated samples. If prompt cell measurement is not feasible, isolated PBMCs can be frozen (at -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C) and processed later with comparable assay reliability (mean value fresh vs. thawing: 0.126, 0.133; Pearson-Coefficient: 0.962).
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 Psychology; Cognitive development; Language; Infancy; Social cognition        	Language provides rich social information about its speakers. For instance, adults and children make inferences about a speaker's social identity, geographic origins, and group membership based on her language and accent. Although infants prefer speakers of familiar languages (Kinzler, Dupoux, & Spelke, 2007), little is known about the developmental origins of humans' sensitivity to language as marker of social identity. We investigated whether 9-month-olds use the language a person speaks as an indicator of that person's likely social relationships. Infants were familiarized with videos of two people who spoke the same or different languages, and then viewed test videos of those two individuals affiliating or disengaging. Results suggest that infants expected two people who spoke the same language to be more likely to affiliate than two people who spoke different languages. Thus, infants view language as a meaningful social marker and use language to make inferences about third-party social relationships.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 cryptographic applications; heterogeneous communications network security; security for distributed networks; cryptographic mechanisms; DTN access control; security in DTN        	Pro-active message's delay tolerant networks (DTNs) are based on the usage of mobile code to obtain messages that contain their own routing code. This architecture allows applications to use the same network in different ways. The keystone of this type of heterogeneous network is a collection of contextual and application-related information that it is stored in every node and accessed by the messages' routing code. Access to that information must be protected in order to make the whole architecture feasible; the operation of the network has to be secure, and attacks of information poisoning have to be avoided. We propose an identity-based access control system for pro-active message's DTN based on tools that are available in DTN networks, like symmetric key encryption and hashes. Our system grants confidentiality and integrity to the contextual information and solves the question of messages needing to use distributed information stored in nodes to route properly. The proof of concept of identity-based access control in a certain kind of application demonstrates the feasibility of the proposal. The comparison between our proposal and other access control systems shows that identity-based access control is the only system that fits well with the special characteristics of pro-active message's DTN.

6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 Olympic venues; Enteric viruses; Water quality; Sediments contamination; Adenovirus diversity; Rio de Janeiro        	Rio de Janeiro's inner and coastal waters are heavily impacted by human sewage pollution for decades. Enteric viruses, including human adenoviruses (HAdV), human enterovirus (EV), group A rotavirus (RV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are more likely to be found in contaminated surface waters. The present work aimed to assess the frequency and loads of EV, HAdV-C and -F species, RV and HAV in sand and water samples from venues used during the 2016 Summer Olympics and by tourists attending the event. Sixteen monthly collections were carried out from March 2015 to July 2016 in 12 different sites from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Total and thermotolerant coliform counting was performed along molecular detection of virus was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Analyses of all samples were further investigated by integrated cell culture PCR to check about the presence of HAdV infectious virus particles. The results show that 95.9% of water samples showed contamination with at least one type of virus. Regarding the viruses individually (% for water and sand respectively): HAdV-C (93.1%-57.8%), HAdV-F (25.3%-0%), RV (12.3%-4.4%), EV (26.7%-8.8%) and HAV (0%). The viral loads ranged from 103 gc/L up to 10(9) gc/L (water), and 10(3) gc/g to 10(6) gc/g (sand). In the phylogenetic tree, were classified into four main clusters, referring to species C, D, F and BAdV. And up to 90% of sites studied presented at least once presence of infectious HAdV-C. The most contaminated points were the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, where Olympic rowing took place, and the Marina da Gloria, the starting point for the sailing races, demonstrating serious problem of fecal contamination of water resources and threatens the health of Olympic athletes, tourists and residents.

5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Fear; children; visual impairments; blind; disability; teachers        	The aim of this study was to investigate childhood fears in children who are blind from the perspective of teachers who are blind. The study was conducted in Jordan. Forty-six teachers were interviewed. Results revealed that the main fear content in children who are blind includes fear of the unknown; environment-,transportation- and people-related fear; and fear of animals. The teachers reported that the reasons for fear in children with visual impairment include child-related reasons (internal reasons), lack of training (hearing, social skills, orientation and mobility [O&M] and tactile training), family factors and an unsuitable physical environment. O&M training, independence training, family counselling and environment adaptation were reported to be the best procedures to deal with fear in these children. Recommendations are provided in the light of the study.

2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 aggression; experimental evaluation; intervention; longitudinal study; media violence        	Objective: This study examined the sustained efficacy of a media violence intervention in reducing media violence use, normative acceptance of aggression, and aggressive behavior in adolescents. It used an experimental design to evaluate the effects of the intervention over a period of 30 months. Method: N = 627 German 7th and 8th graders were assigned to a 5-week school-based intervention to reduce media violence use or to a no-intervention control group. Media violence use, normative acceptance of aggression, and aggressive behavior were measured 3 months before the intervention (T1), 7 months post intervention (T2), and at 2 follow-ups 18 (T3) and 30 (T4) months after the intervention. This article focuses on the findings from the 2 follow-ups. Results: Controlling for baseline levels and various demographic covariates, media violence use at T2, T3, and T4 and self-reported physical aggression at T3 were significantly lower in the intervention group, and the indirect path from the intervention to T3 aggression via T2 media violence use was significant. Lower T2 media violence use predicted lower T3 normative acceptance of aggression among participants with lower initial aggression. No effects on nonviolent media use and relational aggression were observed. Conclusion: The findings show that a short class-based intervention can produce lasting changes in media violence use that are linked to a decrease in aggression.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Bi-directional communication; heating system; intelligent system; Internet of Things; machine to machine; wireless        	In application systems of the Internet of Things (IoT), real-time monitoring and control of the systems need to be realized with wireless communications from machine to machine (M2M), especially under harsh application scenarios. The data link of the M2M communication has also a critical effect on the system in the application. In this paper, a wireless bi-directional data link for smart temperature recording is reported. The radio frequency hardware employed consists of NRF24L01 wireless transceivers, RFX2401 amplifiers and matching network sand antennas. The microcontroller unit (MCU) is based on the STM32F103VET6 chip, which controls the NRF24L01 by a four-pin serial peripheral interface (SPI) to realize the bi-directional data link, and the sensor data are sampled with 12-bit analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs). The communication is realized as the interrupt request (IRQ) signal of the NRF24L01 changes periodically. A look-up table and a linear optimization method are also implemented to improve the accuracy of ADC data. The bi-directional data link is then applied to a wired heating control system. The results show that temperature data can be transmitted and received over a distance up to 320 m in an open environment and 52 m in an indoor complex environment with the hardware implemented. The real-time temperature data can be displayed on a computer or a handheld device. Wireless M2M communication and control are thus demonstrated.

According of our proposed approach, of which implementation it is possible to create the couples of formal rules of given sentences (in case of natural languages) or statements (in case of special languages) by helping of computer vision, speech recognition or editable text conversion system for further automatic improvement. In other words, we have developed an approach, by which it can be achieved to significantly improve the training process automation of artificial intelligence, which as a result will give us a higher level of self-developing skills independently from us (from users). At the base of our approach we have developed a software demo version, which includes the algorithm and software code for the entire above mentioned component's implementation (computer vision, speech recognition and editable text conversion system). The program has the ability to work in a multi - stream mode and simultaneously create a syntax based on receiving information from several sources.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 breast cancer; cost-effectiveness; digital breast tomosynthesis; screening mammography        	OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a cost-effective alternative to full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for both Medicare and privately insured patients undergoing screening mammography. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective data analysis was performed between July 15, 2013, and July 14, 2014, with data on women presenting for screening mammography that included any additional radiologic workup (n = 6319). Patients chose to undergo DBT or FFDM on the basis of personal preference, physician suggestion, and cost difference. The summation of findings over the 1-year period were used to calculate recall rates, cancer detection rates, and billing costs for a regional private insurer and Medicare. RESULTS. Data from the 6319 patients who participated were divided: 3655 patients underwent DBT, and 2664 underwent FFDM during the year of screening. Private insurance billing cost $2.9 million, and Medicare cost $1.2 million for screening, follow-up imaging, and radiologic procedures. Per-person costs were approximately $40 higher for the DBT group using both forms of insurance. However, cost per cancer detected was lower in the DBT group for both private and governmental insurance, leading to potentially $3.7 million and $899,000 saved per 100 cancers found. After standardization of the difference in cancer detection rates between the two groups, DBT was a cost-equivalent alternative to FFDM for private insurance billing but was a cost-inefficient alternative with respect to Medicare costs. CONCLUSION. In a community-based setting, DBT is a cost-equivalent or potentially cost-effective alternative to FFDM and has the capacity for improving cancer detection and recall rates.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 urbanization; water consumption; water supply; water resources        	United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 targets access to water and sanitation for all people in the next 15 years. However, for developing countries such as Nepal, it is more challenging to achieve this goal given its poor infrastructure and high population growth. To assess the water crisis in the most developed and populated area of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley, we estimated available water resources and domestic water demand in the valley. We estimated a supply deficit of 102 million liters per day (MLD) in 2016, after completion of the first phase of the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). If the MWSP is completed within the specified timeframe, and sufficient treatment and distribution infrastructure is developed, then there would be no water deficit by 2023-2025. This indicates that the MWSP will make a significant contribution to the valley's water security. However, emphasis must be given to utilizing all of the water available from the MWSP by developing sufficient water treatment and distribution infrastructure. Alternate mitigation options, such as planning land use for potential recharge, introducing micro- to macro-level rainwater harvesting structures, conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources, and water demand-side management, would also be helpful.
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 ICD code labeling; multi-label learning; sparsity-based regularization; disease correlation embedding        	With the latest developments in database technologies, it becomes easier to store the medical records of hospital patients from their first day of admission than was previously possible. In Intensive Care Units (ICU), modern medical information systems can record patient events in relational databases every second. Knowledge mining from these huge volumes of medical data is beneficial to both caregivers and patients. Given a set of electronic patient records, a system that effectively assigns the disease labels can facilitate medical database management and also benefit other researchers, e.g., pathologists. In this paper, we have proposed a framework to achieve that goal. Medical chart and note data of a patient are used to extract distinctive features. To encode patient features, we apply a Bag-of-Words encoding method for both chart and note data. We also propose a model that takes into account both global information and local correlations between diseases. Correlated diseases are characterized by a graph structure that is embedded in our sparsity-based framework. Our algorithm captures the disease relevance when labeling disease codes rather than making individual decision with respect to a specific disease. At the same time, the global optimal values are guaranteed by our proposed convex objective function. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a real-world large-scale ICU database. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method improves multi-label classification results by successfully incorporating disease correlations.
5	8	80	Medical 	 Autism  	 Engineering ethics; Virtue ethics; Autism spectrum disorder; Rules; Moral psychology; Ethics education        	Virtue-based approaches to engineering ethics have recently received considerable attention within the field of engineering education. Proponents of virtue ethics in engineering argue that the approach is practically and pedagogically superior to traditional approaches to engineering ethics, including the study of professional codes of ethics and normative theories of behavior. This paper argues that a virtue-based approach, as interpreted in the current literature, is neither practically or pedagogically effective for a significant subpopulation within engineering: engineers with high functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Because the main argument for adopting a character-based approach is that it could be more successfully applied to engineering than traditional rule-based or algorithmic ethical approaches, this oversight is problematic for the proponents of the virtue-based view. Furthermore, without addressing these concerns, the wide adoption of a virtue-based approach to engineering ethics has the potential to isolate individuals with ASD and to devalue their contributions to moral practice. In the end, this paper gestures towards a way of incorporating important insights from virtue ethics in engineering that would be more inclusive of those with ASD.
1	10	27	ECE 	 Satellite radio  	 Loxodonta africana; conservation; habitat-use; migration; GPS-collars        	As migratory animals, sustainable management of African elephant populations, both within and around protected areas, is a major challenge in the conservation policy of many African countries. We captured seven female elephants, representative members of family groups, in different parts of Tarangire National Park (TNP), Tanzania, and used GPS satellite radio-tracking (November 1997-June 2000) to monitor their space and habitat use and seasonal migrations throughout wet and dry seasons. Patterns of home range overlap revealed the existence of two Large clans that occupied the north-central and southern parts of TNP, respectively. At the end of the dry season, elephants from the southern clan migrated about 100 km southeast of the park boundary, those from the northern clan remained mostly inside the park, or used periodically wet-season core areas in the nearby Game Controlled Areas. No natural mortality occurred during the study, but two elephants were poached outside the park. Human disturbance also affected activity patterns, and elephants were Less active at day outside than inside the park. Home range size varied from 477 to 1078 km(2) for the northern elephants, and from 1630 to 5060 km(2) for the southern elephants. Migration routes were characterised by higher cover (open and closed forest) than core areas. Our results indicate that elephant management must be considered across park boundaries and that migration corridors must be protected against human disturbance and land cultivation. Society problems Linked to elephant conservation can be solved by creating alternative, sustainable, use of natural resources that enhance the livelihood of Local communities.

5	50	122	Medical 	 Sports Injuries  	 Fractures; Stress; Wounds and injuries; Cumulative trauma disorders        	Background: Stress fractures are a common overuse injury of bone, comprising up to 10% of all sports injuries, and resulting in pain and loss of game time. They are a consequence of repetitive loading forces on the bone and are often seen in response to an increase in activity or training load. They are especially common in the lower leg in athletes involved in running or jumping sports. Objectives: The objective of this review is to examine the management of stress fractures of the lower leg in athletes. The review discusses pathomechanism and etiology, and management, such as relative rest and activity modification, the use of pneumatic leg bracing, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, laser therapy, foot orthoses, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), less commonly used approaches, and surgery. The review also evaluates the specific management of individual stress fracture sites. Major findings: For stress fractures at low risk of delayed and nonunion, relative rest and activity modification is recommended. The literature regarding other modalities has had mixed results, with studies of low quality or based on military populations. Surgery may be necessary for stress fractures at high risk of delayed or nonunion that do not respond to aggressive nonweight-bearing management. The characteristics of specific stress fracture sites need to be considered throughout rehabilitation. Conclusions: It is difficult to draw conclusions from the literature regarding the many modalities clinically used to manage stress fractures. Further research into these modalities and research into specific stress fracture sites would be useful to guide practice.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Inorganic compounds; Oxides; Optical properties; Catalytic properties        	Water pollution resulting from toxic organic pollutants has become a global issue and identification of a suitable low cost and non-toxic material possessing catalytic behavior is indispensable in order to circumvent this enigma. For solving this problem, we herein report a quick, cost effective, surfactant-free microwave assisted route for the preparation of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanostructures and its photocatalytic performances. Structural, morphological and compositional aspects of the nanostructures were determined by various characterization techniques. The photocatalytic efficacies of the samples monitored for the UV induced degradation of aqueous rhodamine B (RhB) solution indicated that all the nanostructures have high photocatalytic capability with superior performance (C/Co) than many existing reports. The highest photocataytic efficiency was obtained for the sample prepared at 0.5 min with 92% efficiency after three cycles experiment and rate constant of 0.042. The possible mechanism for the growth of ZnO nanostructures and photo degradation is also reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	29	101	Medical 	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome  	 Aggression; Blood-brain barrier; Enrofloxacin; Gut-brain axis; Immune system; Investigation; Scent-marking        	The gut microbiome is a diverse, host-specific, and symbiotic bacterial environment that is critical for mammalian survival and exerts a surprising yet powerful influence on brain and behavior. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to a wide range of physical and psychological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and anxiety, as well as autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. A wealth of information on the effects of dysbiosis on anxiety and depression has been reported in laboratory model systems (e.g., germ-free mice); however, the effects of microbiome disruption on social behaviors (e.g., aggression) of non model species that may be particularly important in understanding many aspects of physiology and behavior have yet to be fully explored. Here we assessed the sex-specific effects of a broad-spectrum antibiotic on the gut microbiome and its effects on social behaviors in male and female Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus). In Experiment 1, we administered a broad-spectrum antibiotic on a short-term basis and found that antibiotic treatment altered the microbial communities in the gut in male and female hamsters. In Experiment 2, we tested the effects of single versus repeated antibiotic treatment (including a recovery phase) on behavior, and found that two, but not one, treatments caused marked decreases in aggressive behavior, but not other social behaviors, in males; aggression returned to normal levels following recovery. Antibiotic-treated females, in contrast, showed decreased aggression after a single treatment, with all other social behaviors unaffected. Unlike males, female aggression did not return to normal during either recovery period. The present findings demonstrate that modest antibiotic treatment results in marked disruption of the gut microbiome in hamsters, akin to research done in other rodent species and humans. Further, we show that treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which has dysbiotic effects, also has robust, sex-specific effects on aggression, a critical behavior in the survival and reproductive success of many rodent species.

0	3	3	CS 	 Cryptography  	 Chaos; semiconductor laser; noise; synchronization; optical communication; bit error rate        	The paper is concerned with analyzing data from an experimental antipodal laser-based chaos shift-keying communication system. Binary messages are embedded in a chaotically behaving laser wave, which is transmitted through a fiberoptic cable and are decoded at the receiver using a second laser synchronized with the emitter laser. Instrumentation in the experimental system makes it particularly interesting to be able to empirically analyze both optical noise and synchronization error as well as bit error rate. Both the noise and error are found to significantly depart in distribution from independent Gaussian. The conclusion from bit error rate results is that the antipodal laser chaos shift-keying system can offer a feasible approach to optical communication. The non-Gaussian optical noise and synchronous error results are a challenge to current theoretical modeling.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Electric vehicle; Energy storage systems (ESS); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Li-ion battery; Resource efficiency; Reuse; Second use        	"Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs recovered from end-of-life electric vehicles (EV) present potential technological, economic and environmental opportunities for improving energy systems and material efficiency. Battery packs can be reused in stationary applications as part of a ""smart grid"", for example to provide energy storage systems (ESS) for load leveling, residential or commercial power. Previous work on EV battery reuse has demonstrated technical viability and shown energy efficiency benefits in energy storage systems modeled under commercial scenarios. The current analysis performs a life cycle assessment (LCA) study on a Li-ion battery pack used in an EV and then reused in a stationary ESS. A complex functional unit is used to combine energy delivered by the battery pack from the mobility function and the stationary ESS. Various scenarios of cascaded ""EV mobility plus reuse in stationary clean electric power scenarios"" are contrasted with ""conventional system mobility with internal combustion engine vehicles plus natural gas peaking power."" Eight years are assumed for first use; with 10 years for reuse in the stationary application. Operational scenarios and environmental data are based on real time-of-day and time-of-year power use. Additional data from LCA databases are utilized. Ontario, Canada, is used as the geographic baseline; analysis includes sensitivity to the electricity mix and battery degradation. Seven environmental categories are assessed using ReCiPe. Results indicate that the manufacturing phase of the Li-ion battery will still dominate environmental impacts across the extended life cycle of the pack (first use in vehicle plus reuse in stationary application). For most impact categories, the cascaded use system appears significantly beneficial compared to the conventional system. By consuming clean energy sources for both use and reuse, global and local environmental stress reductions can be supported. Greenhouse gas advantages of vehicle electrification can be doubled by extending the life of the EV batteries, and enabling better use of off-peak low-cost clean electricity or intermittent renewable capacity. However, questions remain concerning implications of long-duration use of raw material resources employed before potential recycling. Li-ion battery packs present opportunities for powering both mobility and stationary applications in the necessary transition to cleaner energy. Battery state-of-health is a considerable determinant in the life cycle performance of a Li-ion battery pack. The use of a complex functional unit was demonstrated in studying a component system with multiple uses in a cascaded application."
2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 childhood abuse; childhood neglect; borderline personality; dissociation; somatic symptoms; psychological dissociation; identity integration; psychotherapy        	"The nature of consciousness and the autonomy of the individual'smind have been a focus of interest throughout the past century and inspired many theories and models. Revival of studies on psychological trauma and dissociation, which remained outside mainstream psychiatry, psychology, and psychoanalysis for the most part of the past century, has provided a new opportunity to revisit this intellectual and scientific endeavor. This paper attempts to integrate a series of empirical and theoretical studies on psychological consequences of developmental traumatization, which may yield further insight into factors which threaten the integrity of human consciousness. The paper proposes that an individual's experience of distorted reality and betrayal precipitates a cyclical dynamic between the individual and the external world by disrupting the developmental function of mutuality which is essential for maintenance of the integrity of the internal world while this inner world is in turn regulated vis-a-vis external reality. Dissociation - the common factor in all types of post-traumatic syndromes-is facilitated by violation of boundaries by relational omission and intrusion as represented by distinct effects and consequences of childhood neglect and abuse. Recent research conducted on clinical and non-clinical populations shows both bimodal (undermodulation and overmodulation) and bipolar (intrusion and avoidance) neurobiological and phenomenological characteristics of post-traumatic response. These seem to reflect ""parallel-distinct structures"" that control separate networks covering sensori-motor and cognitive-emotional systems. This understanding provides a conceptual framework to assist explanation of diverse post-traumaticmental trajectories which culminate in a common final pathway comprised of partly overlapping clinical syndromes such as complex PTSD, dissociative depression, dissociative identity disorder (DID), or ""borderline"" phenomena. Of crucial theoretical and clinical importance is that thesemaladaptive post-traumatic psychological formations are regarded as processes in their own right rather than as a personality disorder innate to the individual. Such mental division may perform in that internal detachment can serve to preserve the genuine aspects of the subject until such time as they can be reclaimed via psychotherapy. The paper attempts to integrate these ideas with reference to the previously proposed theory of the ""Functional Dissociation of Self"" (Sar and Ozturk, 2007)."
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 AIDS; antimullerian hormone; hepatitis C virus infection; HIV; menopause; ovarian reserve; viremia        	BACKGROUND: HIV infection has been associated with early menopausal onset, which may have adverse long-term health consequences. Antimullerian hormone, a biomarker of ovarian reserve and gonadal aging, is reduced in HIV-infected women. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the relationship of antimullerian hormone to age of menopause onset in HIV-infected women. STUDY DESIGN: We used antimullerian hormone levels measured in plasma in 2461 HIV-infected participants from the Women's Interagency HIV Study to model the age at final menstrual period. Multivariable normal mixture models for censored data were used to identify factors associated with age at final menstrual period. RESULTS: Higher antimullerian hormone at age 40 years was associated with later age at final menstrual period, even after multivariable adjustment for smoking, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV RNA, hepatitis C infection, and history of clinical AIDS. Each doubling of antimullerian hormone was associated with a 1.5-year increase in the age at final menstrual period. Median age at final menstrual period ranged from 45 years for those in the 10th percentile of antimullerian hormone to 52 years for those in the 90th percentile. Other factors independently associated with earlier age at final menstrual period included smoking, hepatitis C infection, higher HIV RNA levels, and history of clinical AIDS. CONCLUSION: Antimullerian hormone is highly predictive of age at final menstrual period in HIV-infected women. Measuring antimullerian hormone in HIV-infected women may enable clinicians to predict risk of early menopause, and potentially implement individualized treatment plans to prevent menopause-related comorbidities and to aid in interpretation of symptoms.
5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 Human immunodeficiency virus; Positron emission tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging; HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment        	Effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has lead to a significant reduction in the prevalence and incidence of central nervous system (CNS) HIV-associated brain disease, particularly CNS opportunistic infections and HIV encephalitis. Despite this, cognitive deficits in people living with HIV, also known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) have become more prevalent in recent years. The pathogenesis of HAND is likely to be multifactorial, however recent evidence suggests that brain microglial activation is the most likely pathogenic mechanism. Recent developments in positron emission tomography (PET) brain neuroimaging using novel brain radioligands targeting a variety of physiological changes in the brains of HIV-positive individuals have improved our understanding of the mechanisms associated with the development of HAND. This review will highlight recent PET brain neuroimaging studies in the cART era, focusing on physiological and neurochemical changes associated with HAND in people living with HIV.
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 Sexual agency; Sexual assertiveness; Gender differences; Sexual behavior; Sexual norms        	Women are less likely than men to engage in sexually agentic behavior (e.g., initiating sexual encounters), despite the benefits associated with sexual agency (Kiefer & Sanchez, 2007). Two studies examined possible explanations, related to person perception, for gender differences in sexually agentic behavior. In Study 1, participants viewed the dating profiles of targets who were either high or low on sexual agency and rated sexually agentic targets as more desirable but also riskier sexual partners (i.e., having more previous sexual partners), as well as more selfish partners overall. Participants believed the agentic female targets to be the most desirable but also to have the highest number of previous sexual partners. In Study 2, female participants weighed the importance and consequences of sexual agency differently than male participants. Based on the two studies, we suggest that although men and women are judged similarly for sexual agency, women may refrain from sexual agency because they view the traits and characteristics that are perceived to go hand in hand with sexual agency more negatively.
1	10	27	ECE 	 Satellite radio  	 SAT-OFDM; satellite component of IMT-Advanced system; LTE; integrated MSS system        	This paper presents the satellite orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SAT-OFDM) technology as a satellite radio interface for international mobile telecommunications (IMT)-Advanced. The SAT-OFDM radio interface is designed to provide various advanced IMT services in satellite environments. For cost-effective deployment of a satellite IMT-Advanced system, the radio interface must have a high degree of commonality with third-generation partnership project long-term evolution (3GPP LTE) technology for IMT-Advanced, but it also has a number of different features. Those features are needed to adapt the 3GPP LTE technology for satellite-specific environments such as long round-trip delay, large cell size, and slow-fading satellite channel. In this paper, we summarize the key features of the SAT-OFDM technology and propose satellite specific features included in the SAT-OFDM technology as an adaption way of LTE over satellite. Then we show the performance evaluation results of the SAT-OFDM technology to see the feasibility of LTE over satellite. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 PD-1; Crohn's disease; vitamin D; T cells; Immunology and Microbiology Section; Immune response; Immunity        	Background: Vitamin D modulates inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). Programmed death (PD)-1 receptor contributes to the maintenance of immune tolerance. Vitamin D might modulate PD-1 signalling in CD. Aim: To investigate PD-1 expression on T cell subsets in CD patients treated with vitamin D or placebo. Methods: We included 40 CD patients who received 1200 IU vitamin D3 for 26 weeks or placebo and eight healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were isolated at baseline and week 26. The expressions of PD1, PD-L1, and surface activation markers were analysed by flow cytometry. Soluble PD-1 plasma levels were measured by ELISA. Results: PD-1 expression upon T cell stimulation was increased in CD4(+)CD25(+int) T cells in vitamin D treated CD patients from 19% (range 10 -39%) to 29% (11 79%)( p = 0.03) compared with placebo-treated patients. Vitamin D treatment, but not placebo, decreased the expression of the T cell activation marker CD69 from 42% (31 - 62%) to 33% (19 - 54%)(p = 0.01). Soluble PD-1 levels were not influenced by vitamin D treatment. Conclusions: Vitamin D treatment increases CD4(+)CD25(+int) T cells ability to upregulate PD-1 in response to activation and reduces the CD69 expression in CD patients.
3	2	54	MAE 	 Manufacturing engineering  	 Finite element analysis; Contact elements; Attached elements; Mesh        	Contact problem, which exists widely in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, manufacturing engineering, etc., is an extremely complicated nonlinear problem. It is usually solved by the finite element method. Unlike with the traditional finite element method, it is necessary to set up contact elements for the contact analysis. In the different types of contact elements, the Goodman joint elements, which cover the surface of contacted bodies with zero thickness, are widely used. However, there are some debates on the characteristics of the attached elements of the Goodman joint elements. For that this paper studies the type, matching, and meshing of the attached elements. The results from this paper would be helpful for the finite element contact analysis.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 thyrotropin; thyroiditis; thyroidy        	Background: Besides genetic factors, it is known that some trace elements, as Selenium, Copper, and Zinc are essential for thyroid gland fuction and thyroid hormone metabolism. Moreover, there were some metals effect that suggested patterns associated with overt thyroid disease. Aim of study: Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), chronic autoimune inflamation of thyroid gland with cosequtive hipothyroidism, is common disease in Serbia, and we thought it is worthwile to explore potential effects of essential and toxic metals and metalloides on thyroid function and ability to restore euthyroid status of them. Results: This cross-sectional, case-control, study investigated the status of essential elements (Selenium,Copper,and Zinc) and toxic metals and metalloides (Al, Cr, Mn, Co, As, Cd, Sb, Ba, Be, Pb and Ni) from the blood of 22 female, patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism, and compared it with those of 55 female healthy persons. We tried to establish the presence of any correlation between previous mentioned elements and thyroid function in hypothyroid patients and healthy participants. Conclusions: The results of our study suggested that the blood concentration of essential trace elements, especially the ratio of Copper, and Selenium may influence directly thyroid function in patients with HT and overt hypothyroidism. Thus, our findings may have implication to life-long substitution therapy in terms of l-thyroxine dose reduction. Furthermore, for the first time, our study shown potential toxic effect of Cadmium on thyroid function in HT patients, which may implicate the dose of l-thyroxine substitution.
5	16	88	Medical 	 Weight Loss  	 Turbostratic; Boron nitride nanosheets; Large scale fabrication; Growth mechanism; Thermal conductivity        	In this report, we have developed a scalable approach to massive synthesis of hexagonal/turbostratic composite boron nitride nanosheets (h/t-BNNSs). The strikingly effective, reliable, and high-throughput (grams) synthesis is performed via a facile chemical foaming process at 1400 degrees C utilizing ammonia borane (AB) as precursor.The characterization results demonstrate that high quality of h/t-BNNSs with lateral size of tens of micrometers and thickness of tens of nanometers are obtained. The growth mechanism of h/t-BNNSs is also discussed based on the thermogravimetric analysis of AB which clearly shows two step weight loss. The h/t-BNNSs are further used for making thermoconductive h/t-BNNSs/epoxy resin composites. The thermal conductivity of the composites is obviously improved due to the introduction of h/t-BNNSs. Consideration of the unique properties of boron nitride, these novel h/t-BNNSs are envisaged to be very valuable for future high performance polymer based material fabrication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

5	22	94	Medical 	 Healthy Sleep  	 Children's sleep; parental knowledge; educational intervention; primary care        	Objective: Insufficient and poor quality sleep is prevalent in children, and is a significant public health concern due to the negative consequences for health. Certain sleep-related behaviours are associated with improved sleep, and sleep behaviours are amenable to efforts targeted towards behaviour change. Parental educational interventions have been successful at improving parents' knowledge and children's health outcomes in some areas of health, but no population-based educational interventions have been designed to improve parents' knowledge of healthy children's sleep. This study aimed to design and test an educational tool to increase caregivers' knowledge of healthy children's sleep in a primary care setting. Setting: A hospital-based pediatric primary care clinic where children attend for well-child and sick visits. Method: Parents of 95 children aged three months to 12 years completed two surveys, one prior to and one after receiving the intervention. The surveys assessed children's sleep habits (pre-intervention) and parental sleep beliefs and sleep knowledge (pre- and post-intervention). The intervention was a short, informational brochure. Results: Following the intervention there was a significant increase in parents' knowledge regarding children's healthy sleep, and in the number of parents who planned to make positive behaviour changes regarding their child's sleep practices. Conclusion: Simple written educational interventions may be effective tools with which to increase parents' knowledge and promote healthy sleep behaviours in children.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 V2V; computer vision; ADAS        	Motorcycles are one of the most dangerous means of transportation. Its death toll is higher than in others, due to the inherent vulnerability of motorcycle drivers. The latest strategies in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) are trying to mitigate this problem by applying the advances of modern technologies to the road transport. This paper presents two different approaches on motorcycle protection, based on two of the most modern available technologies in ADAS, i.e. Computer Vision and Vehicle to Vehicle Communication (V2V). The first approach is based on data fusion of Laser Scanner and Computer Vision, providing accurate obstacle detection and localization based on laser scanner, and obstacle classification using computer vision and laser. The second approach is based on ad-hoc V2V technology and provides detection in case of occlusion for visual sensors. Both technologies have been tested in the presented work, and a performance comparison is given. Tests performed in different driving situations allows to measure the performance of every algorithm and the limitations of each of them based on empirical and scientific foundations. The conclusions of the presented work help foster of expert systems in the automotive sector by providing further discussion of the viability and impact from each of these systems in real scenarios.

3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 engineering education; problem solving; ideal solution; conceptual design; structural analysis; machine design; safety of product; designer's liability        	The Design of Machine Elements course is one of the most difficult and complicated courses in the Mechanical Engineering program. It requires inventive concept generation, the knowledge of geometrical design, and basic knowledge of stress and deformation analyses. On those three elements, the machine elements design philosophy is established and further developed. The course material has to be chosen carefully since the time constrains will allow to cover design of only few essential machine elements. The material is covered by lectures, textbook readings, homework problems, and design projects. In addition to the textbook content the course contains five special elements: Idea Generation, Safety Considerations, Design of the Day (DoD), a Designer's Liability study, and three projects including Final Project Shaft Design. In the Idea Generation project, students generate an idea of machine or mechanical device. The Safety Consideration project is done by inspection and documentation of unsafe elements on campus. The Shaft Design Project had students design a shaft system under given constrains. In DoD students present existing advanced machines chosen using different sources or their own industrial internship experience. The Liability assignment addresses the designer's legal responsibility in case of a defective product that caused an injury or accident. The material taught in the course is larger than conventional machine element design course. The elements added that are beyond the structural analysis bring better understanding of engineering problems during the Senior Design course and later during engineering practice. They allow the students to connect the theory with the real world of engineering challenges. This gives students more satisfaction during the learning process and cognitive benefits during engineering practice. The unconventional inventive design approach of the teaching team (course instructor and GTA) to problem solving is based on many years of instructor's experience in teaching of engineering problem solving and design. The learning pattern in which students work in teams, both in problem solving and in design exercises, also helps to conduct the course. Thanks to all these elements the learning experience of the course is unique and engaging despite the high level of difficulty associated with it.
5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 heart failure; testosterone; rats; atrial natriuretic peptide; brain natriuretic peptide; sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; matrix metalloproteinase; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase; glycogen synthase kinase; caspase-3; cardiomyocyte apoptosis; ventricular remodeling        	Men with congestive heart failure (CHF) have relatively low testosterone levels. Several studies demonstrated that testosterone treatment increases cardiac output and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. However, the effects of testosterone on heart function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling have not been fully elucidated. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of testosterone on heart function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and ventricular remodeling in male rats post-myocardial infarction. A total of 86 male rats were randomly assigned to undergo ligation of the coronary artery (n=70) or pseudosurgery (n=16). After 6 weeks, a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% was defined as a successful model of CHF. The model rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups, namely low-dose testosterone (TU), high-dose TU and placebo (PL) groups. After treatment for 12 weeks, the expression of several mRNA transcripts in myocardial tissue was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Immunofluorescence was used to measure myocardial caspase-3 expression. Compared to the PL group, LVEF was significantly improved in the TU treatment groups. Moreover, the mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a was significantly reduced, while the mRNA expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 was markedly increased in the TU groups. TU treatment also significantly reduced caspase-3 expression. Therefore, different doses of TU suppressed ventricular remodeling and improved left ventricular function, reduced apoptosis and prevented mortality in a CHF rat model.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 diagnostics; meningitis; therapeutics and sequelae; virus        	Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to give an overview of viral meningitis and then focus in on some of the areas of uncertainty in diagnostics, treatment and outcome. Recent findings Bacterial meningitis has been declining in incidence over recent years. Over a similar time period molecular diagnostics have increasingly been used. Because of both of these developments viral meningitis is becoming relatively more important. However, there are still many unanswered questions. Despite improvements in diagnostics many laboratories do not use molecular methods and even when they are used many cases still remain without a proven viral aetiology identified. There are also no established treatments for viral meningitis and the one potential treatment, aciclovir, which is effective in vitro for herpes simplex virus, has never been subjected to a clinical trial. Summary Viruses are in increasingly important cause of meningitis in the era of declining bacterial disease. The exact viral aetiology varies according to age and country. Molecular diagnostics can not only improve the rate of pathogen detection but also reduce unnecessary antibiotics use and length of hospitalization. Further research is required into treatments for viral meningitis and the impact in terms of longer term sequelae.
5	21	93	Medical 	 Headache  	 Migraine; allodynia; fMRI; volumetric MRI; trigeminal stimulation        	Objective: A prospective clinical imaging study has been conducted to investigate pain processing functional pathways during trigeminal heat stimulation (THS) in patients with migraine without aura experiencing ictal cutaneous allodynia (CA) (MwoA CA+). Methods: Using whole-brain BOLD-fMRI, functional response to THS at three different intensities (41 degrees, 51 degrees and 53 degrees C) was investigated interictally in 20 adult MwoA CA+ patients compared with 20 MwoA patients without ictal CA (MwoA CA-) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Secondary analyses evaluated associations between BOLD signal change and clinical features of migraine. Results: During moderate-noxious THS (51 degrees C), we observed a significantly greater activation in (a) the anterior cingulate cortex in MwoA CA+ patients compared to HCs and (b) the middle frontal gyrus in MwoA CA+ patients compared to both MwoA CA- patients and HCs. Furthermore, during high-noxious THS (53 degrees C) a significantly decreased activation in the secondary somatosensory cortices was observed in (a) MwoA CA- patients compared to both MwoA CA+ patients and HCs and (b) MwoA CA+ patients compared to HCs. CA severity was positively correlated with the secondary somatosensory cortices activation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CA may be subtended by both a dysfunctional analgesic compensatory mechanism and an abnormal internal representation of pain in migraine patients.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 Suspension bridge; dynamic balance method; bending rigidity; strand tension control; frequency method; least squares method        	Strand tension control is essential in suspension bridge safety. However, few quantitative studies have examined the bending rigidity and boundary condition behavior of strands in the anchor span of suspension bridges because of their special structure and complex configuration. In this paper, a new calculation method for strand tension is explored by using dynamic balance theory to determine the effect of bending rigidity and boundary conditions. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are tested and confirmed with verification examples and application on Nanxi Yangtze Suspension Bridge in China. The results indicated that only low-order frequency calculation could be used to calculate the strand tension without considering the effect of bending rigidity to ensure control accuracy. The influence of bending rigidity on the control precision is related to the tension and the length of the strands, which is significantly determined by the specific value between the stress rigidity and the bending rigidity. The uncertain boundary conditions of the anchor span cable, which are fixed between consolidated and hinged, also have a major effect on the control accuracy. To improve the accuracy of strand tension control, the least squares method is proposed during the tension construction control of the anchor span. This approach can significantly improve the accuracy of the tension control of the main cable strand. Some recommendations for future bridge analysis are provided based on the results of this study.

The homotopy renormalisation method is simple and powerful for finding global approximate solutions to nonlinear perturbed differential equations arising in mathematical physics.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 QTL mapping; RHadoop; PruneDIRECT; DIRECT; map-reduce; permutation testing        	In quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping significance of putative QTL is often determined using permutation testing. The computational needs to calculate the significance level are immense, 10(4) up to 10(8) or even more permutations can be needed. We have previously introduced the PruneDIRECT algorithm for multiple QTL scan with epistatic interactions. This algorithm has specific strengths for permutation testing. Here, we present a flexible, parallel computing framework for identifying multiple interacting QTL using the PruneDIRECT algorithm which uses the map-reduce model as implemented in Hadoop. The framework is implemented in R, a widely used software tool among geneticists. This enables users to rearrange algorithmic steps to adapt genetic models, search algorithms, and parallelization steps to their needs in a flexible way. Our work underlines the maturity of accessing distributed parallel computing for computationally demanding bioinformatics applications through building workflows within existing scientific environments. We investigate the PruneDIRECT algorithm, comparing its performance to exhaustive search and DIRECT algorithm using our framework on a public cloud resource. We find that Prune DIRECT is vastly superior for permutation testing, and perform 2 x 10(5) permutations for a 2D QTL problem in 15 hours, using 100 cloud processes. We show that our framework scales out almost linearly for a 3D QTL search.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Coral reefs; Participatory mapping; Coral reef management; US Virgin Islands; SCUBA; Local ecological knowledge        	"Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef ""experts"" in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention."
5	5	77	Medical 	 Asthma  	 sandstorm; emergency; respiratory; disaster management; Qatar        	The State of Qatar experienced a sandstorm on the night of April 1, 2015, lasting approximately 12 hours, with winds of more than 100 km/h and average particulate matter of approximately 10 m in diameter. The emergency department (ED) of the main tertiary hospital in Qatar managed 62% of the total emergency calls and those of higher triage order. The peak load of patients during the event manifested approximately 6 hours after the onset. The Major Emergency Command Centre of the hospital ensured the department was maximally organized in terms of disaster management, and established protocols were brought into action. Multiple timely meetings were convened in efforts to effectively execute plans that included rapid emergency medical services handover time, resourcing staff, maximizing bed space, preventing dust entry in the ED, bypassing certain administrative processes, canceling day-surgeries that did not affect inpatient morbidity, and procuring additional respiratory equipment. Patients arrived mainly with exacerbations of asthma and respiratory distress, ophthalmic emergencies, and vehicular trauma; surprisingly, the incidence of pedestrian injuries did not vary.
5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 Cerebral microbleeds; Dementia; Cerebral small vessel disease; Brain MRI        	Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are MRI markers attributed to the most common cerebral angiopathies in the elderly and in patients with dementia: hypertensive and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CMB detection in asymptomatic persons may help identify those at risk for dementia and may influence preventive strategies and design of clinical trials testing treatments for dementia. We studied the association of CMB with risk of incident dementia in community dwelling individuals. A total of 1296 dementia-free Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 72 years; 54% women) with available brain MRI and incident dementia data during a mean follow-up period of 6.7 years were included. Using Cox proportional hazards models, we related CMB presence to incident dementia. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, APOE status, and education, with additional models adjusting for vascular risk factors and MRI markers of ischemic brain injury. CMBs were observed in 10.8% and incident dementia in 85 participants (6.6% over study period). Participants with any CMB had 1.74 times higher risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-3.01), whereas those with deep and mixed CMB had a three-fold increased risk (HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.52-5.90). The associations were independent of vascular risk factors, and for deep and mixed CMB also independent of MRI markers of ischemia (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.22-4.88). Purely lobar CMBs were not associated with incident dementia. Our findings support a role for hypertensive vasculopathy and the interplay of hypertensive and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in risk of dementia and suggest that CMB presence can identify individuals at risk of dementia.

5	0	72	Medical 	 Addiction  	 digit ratio; impulsivity; Internet addiction; 2D        	Background and aims: The ratio of the second and fourth fingers (2D:4D ratio) is a sexually dimorphic trait, with men tending to have lower values than women. This ratio has been related to prenatal testosterone concentrations and addictive behaviors including problematic video-gaming. We aimed to investigate the possible association between 2D: 4D ratios and Internet addiction and whether such a relationship would be independent of impulsivity. Methods: A total of 652 university students (369 women, 283 men), aged 17-27 years, were enrolled in the study. Problematic and pathological Internet use (PPIU) was assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). The participants also completed the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (version 11; BIS-11) and had their 2D: 4D ratios measured. Results: 2D: 4D ratios were not significantly different in women with PPIU and in those with adaptive Internet use (AIU). Men with PPIU exhibited lower 2D: 4D ratios on both hands when compared with those with AIU. Correlation analysis revealed that 2D: 4D ratios on both hands were negatively correlated with IAT scores among men, but not among women. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, duration of weekly Internet use, impulsiveness, and 2D: 4D ratios on the right hand were independently associated with IAT scores among men, and impulsivity did not mediate the relationship between 2D: 4D ratios and PPIU. Conclusions: For men, 2D: 4D ratios on the right hand were inversely correlated with Internet addiction severity even after controlling for individual differences in impulsivity. These findings suggest that high prenatal testosterone levels may contribute to the occurrence of PPIU among men.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 photovoltaic materials; Mott insulator; thin film; transitional-metal oxide; physical vapor deposition        	Mott insulating oxides and their heterostructures have recently been identified as potential photovoltaic materials with favorable absorption properties and an intrinsic built-in electric field that can efficiently separate excited electron hole pairs. At the same time, they are predicted to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit due to strong electron electron interaction present. Despite these premises a high concentration of defects commonly observed in Mott insulating films acting as recombination centers can derogate the photovoltaic conversion efficiency. With use of the self-regulated growth kinetics in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, this obstacle can be overcome. High-quality, stoichiometric LaVO3 films were grown with defect densities of in-gap states up to 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to the films in the literature, and a factor of 3 lower than LaVO3 bulk single crystals. Photoconductivity measurements revealed a significant photoresponsivity increase as high as tenfold of stoichiometric LaVO3 films compared to their nonstoichiometric counterparts. This work marks a critical step toward the realization of high-performance Mott insulator solar cells beyond conventional semiconductors.
0	3	3	CS 	 Cryptography  	 Automotive; security; authentication; authorization; lightweight        	With the increasing amount of interconnections between vehicles, the attack surface of internal vehicle networks is rising steeply. Although these networks are shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal security to protect against malicious components or adversaries who can breach the network perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be allowed to send and receive-messages. This is achieved through the use of an authentication framework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties and provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication). However, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. In particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during vehicle operation. In this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols for automotive systems. We present Lightweight Authentication for Secure Automotive Networks (LASAN), a full lifecycle authentication approach. We describe the core LASAN protocols and show how they protect the internal vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low computational resources of this domain. By lever-aging the fixed structure of automotive networks, we minimize bandwidth and computation requirements. Unlike previous work, we also explain how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive product lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates. We evaluate LASAN in two different ways: First, we analyze the security properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques based on formal methods. Second, we evaluate the timing requirements of LASAN and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 Photocatalysis; Hydrogen production; Noble-metal-free cocatalyst        	Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a potential route for converting inexhaustible solar energy into available clean chemical energy. Herein, highly efficient and stable Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3/TiO2 photocatalysts for hydrogen generation are prepared by incorporating Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3 clusters onto the surface of TiO2 through a facile precipitation method. The obtained Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3/TiO2 photocatalyst with optimal Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3 content of 0.5 mol% shows an outstanding photocatalytic H-2-production rate of 6713 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) (with apparent quantum efficiency of 15.4% at 365 nm), which is comparable to the excellent Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst and more efficient than other copper specie modified TiO2 photocatalyst. The formation of Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3/Cu+/Cu-0 clusters essentially contribute to the enhanced H-2-production activity by reducing the over-potential of water reduction and promoting the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to the Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3/Cu+/Cu-0 clusters. A high stability of the Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3/TiO2 photocatalyst is achieved due to the re-oxidation process of Cu+/Cu-0 to Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3 and structure confinement of Cu-2(OH)(2)CO3 clusters in the mesopores of TiO2. This work brings in new insight in developing low-cost noble-metal-free photocatalytic system for solar-to-fuel conversion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Divorce rate; birth control pill; sales bans; unilateral divorce; J12; J13; J18        	This paper explores the relationship between the advent of the birth control pill and divorce rates. Women using the pill can decide when and whether to have children and whether to maintain their attachment to the labor force. This ability may increase women's autonomy, making divorce more feasible. The pill's effects are identified through a quasi-experiment exploiting differences in the language of the Comstock anti-obscenity statutes approved in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States. Empirical evidence from state-level data on US divorce rates 1950 to 1985 shows that sales bans of oral contraceptives have a negative impact on divorce. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as women's labor force participation) and unobserved state-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the state level. Results suggest that the impact of women's control of hormonal contraception on their autonomy is important in divorce decisions.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Abortion; Cognitive ability; Selection        	The relationship between maternal cognitive ability (as indicated by g and highest attained educational level) and self-reported numbers of abortions at near-completed fertility is investigated in two, population representative samples of the US: (i) a sample of 1386 women, sourced from NLSY'79 (aged 39-47), and (ii) a sample 842 women (aged 38-45), sourced from NSFG'11-13. No linear relationships between either of the cognitive ability measures and abortion numbers were found, nor were quadratic effects present in these data. Income had an independent negative effect on abortion numbers in the NSFG'11-13 sample, whereas age was a positive independent predictor in the NLSY'79 sample. The essentially zero-magnitude association between maternal cognitive ability and abortion numbers may have resulted from the wide scale destigmatization of elective abortion as a birth-control technique in the US following the 1973 US Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade. Despite this, self-reported abortion numbers data typically underrepresent the true numbers of abortions hence these findings must be considered tentative especially if underreporting is unsystematic with respect to any of the predictors.

5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 Annona squamosa L.; Annonaceous acetogenins; Annonacin; Atypical Parkinsonism; Bullatacin; HPLC-MS/MS; Squamocin        	Annonaceous acetogenins (AAGs) are neurotoxins possibly responsible for atypical Parkinsonism/dementia clusters, via the consumption of edible Annonaceae fruits. Their presence was investigated in fruit pulps of Annona squamosa from different locations. Qualitative analysis of other AAGs was performed. We here report the identification of squamocin in batches from Asia, the Caribbean Basin and the Indian Ocean. This molecule was quantified by HPLC-UV, evidencing a content of 13.5-36.4 mg/fruit. HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF allowed the detection of 25 different raw formulas matching with AAGs. LC-MS/MS methodological development was performed using 4 representative standards. The main AAGs could be annotated, including bullatacin (rolliniastatin-2) and annonacin. This study evidences a remarkable homogeneity for the main AAGs within the species, and discrepancies for minor compounds. These findings indicate that A. squamosa should be considered a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 mu ECoG; somatosensory evoked potential; finger somatotopy; brain-machine interface; machine learning; sensory decoding        	Electrocorticogram (ECoG) has great potential as a source signal, especially for clinical BMI. Until recently, ECoG electrodes were commonly used for identifying epileptogenic foci in clinical situations, and such electrodes were low-density and large. Increasing the number and density of recording channels could enable the collection of richer motor/sensory information, and may enhance the precision of decoding and increase opportunities for controlling external devices. Several reports have aimed to increase the number and density of channels. However, few studies have discussed the actual validity of high-density ECoG arrays. In this study, we developed novel high-density flexible ECoG arrays and conducted decoding analyses with monkey somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). Using MEMS technology, we made 96-channel Parylene electrode arrays with an inter-electrode distance of 700 mu m and recording site area of 350 mu m(2). The arrays were mainly placed onto the finger representation area in the somatosensory cortex of the macaque, and partially inserted into the central sulcus. With electrical finger stimulation, we successfully recorded and visualized finger SEPs with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We conducted offline analyses in which the stimulated fingers and intensity were predicted from recorded SEPs using a support vector machine. We obtained the following results: (1) Very high accuracy (similar to 98%) was achieved with just a short segment of data (similar to 15 ms from stimulus onset). (2) High accuracy (similar to 96%) was achieved even when only a single channel was used. This result indicated placement optimality for decoding. (3) Higher channel counts generally improved prediction accuracy, but the efficacy was small for predictions with feature vectors that included time-series information. These results suggest that ECoG signals with high spatiotemporal resolution could enable greater decoding precision or external device control.
5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 HUD (U; S; Department of Housing and Urban Development); low-income housing; neighborhood; policy; underserved; rental housing        	We used the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing experiment to inform how Housing Choice Vouchers and housing mobility policies can assist families living in high-poverty areas to make opportunity moves to higher quality neighborhoods, across a wide range of neighborhood attributes. We compared the neighborhood attainment of the three randomly assigned MTO treatment groups (low-poverty voucher, Section 8 voucher, control group) at 1997 and 2002 locations (4-7years after baseline), using survey reports, and by linking residential histories to numerous different administrative and population-based data sets. Compared with controls, families in low-poverty and Section 8 groups experienced substantial improvements in neighborhood conditions across diverse measures, including economic conditions, social systems (e.g., collective efficacy), physical features of the environment (e.g., tree cover) and health outcomes. The low-poverty voucher group, moreover, achieved better neighborhood attainment compared with Section 8. Treatment effects were largest for New York, New York, and Los Angeles, California. We discuss the implications of our findings for expanding affordable housing policy.
5	2	74	Medical 	 Alzheimer's Disease  	 Adult stem cells; Autologous stem cell transplantation; Adipose; Cellular therapy; Clinical trials; Mesenchymal stem cells        	Due to their capacity to self-renew, proliferate and generate multi-lineage cells, adult-derived stem cells offer great potential for use in regenerative therapies to stop and/or reverse degenerative diseases such as diabetes, heart failure, Alzheimer's disease and others. However, these subsets of cells can be isolated from different niches, each with differing potential for therapeutic applications. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF), a stem cell enriched and adipose-derived cell population, has garnered interest as a therapeutic in regenerative medicine due to its ability to secrete paracrine factors that accelerate endogenous repair, ease of accessibility and lack of identified major adverse effects. Thus, one can easily understand the rush to employ adipose-derived SVF to treat human disease. Perhaps faster than any other cell preparation, SVF is making its way to clinics worldwide, while critical preclinical research needed to establish SVF safety, efficacy and optimal, standardized clinical procedures are underway. Here, we will provide an overview of the current knowledge driving this phenomenon, its regulatory issues and existing studies, and propose potential unmapped applications.
3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 Metallosurfactant; Nanoparticles; Antimicrobial activity; Solvophobic interactions; Protein interactions        	The work deals with optimizing a methodology for fabrication of monodisperse metallic nanoparticles (active against microbes) using micellar core of amine based metallosurfactant. Novel double chained amine metallosurfactants of the type [M(C12H25NH2)(2)] (where M is copper, nickel and cobalt) have been synthesized and characterized with elemental analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Further, study of theaggregated structures (i.e. bilayer) of these lipophilic metallosurfactants in various alcohols has been carried out. Thermodynamics parameters of reverse micellization have also been estimated. The process of micellization is spontaneous and entropy driven. Prepared metallosurfactants have been utilized as precursors for the fabrication of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) of Co, Ni and Cu. The method is validated for all the three studied transition metals for the preparation of metallic nanoparticles. This approach offers better results in terms of size, shape, morphology, distribution and stability of NPs. Characterization of NPs is done by UV-vis, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Emission Microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic light scattering (DLS). Prepared metallosurfactants and NPs have been trialled for antimicrobial activity against three pathogenic microbes viz. Bacillus Cereus (gram +ve bacterium), Klebsiella Pneumoniae (gram -ve bacterium) and Curvularia lunata (fungus) and best results are shown by Cu NPs. Furthermore, interaction of metallic NPs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) has been estimated. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 habase; city's smart-heathcare data center; NoSQL; front-end web; O-R model        	To deal with information incompleteness or error and supervising difficulties caused by hardships in information synergy and sharing among current medical institutions, this article proposes a solution to construct a city's smart-heathcare data system. Through the design of synchronizing each medical institution's heterogeneous database to data center, the aforementioned problems are solved. By analyzing the needs of city's medical data center, this article takes NoSQL database and hadoop as the basis of system construction. Meanwhile, through comparative analysis of several existing NoSQL databases, Habase is found suitable for storing and processing massive data. This article proposes a new database modeling thought, O-R (Object Relationship) modeling, by reference to E-R relational database modeling. This O-R modeling thought compensates for non-relational databases' deficiencies in front of relational databases. Utilizing this new modeling thought and the solution to synchronize heterogeneous databases identically to data center, the article completes the construction of the city's smart-heathcare data system.
6	8	133	biochemistry 	 Southern blotting  	 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10 beta-O-acetyltransferase; paclitaxel; baccatin III; bioconversion; Flammulina velutipes        	BACKGROUND: 10-Deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) and baccatin III are intermediates in the biosynthesis of Taxol (an anticancer drug) and useful precursors for semi-synthesis of the drug. In this study, a bioconversion system was established for the production of baccatin III, an advanced precursor of paclitaxel, in the transgenic mushroom Flammulina velutipes expressing the 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10 beta-O-acetyltransferase gene. The expression vector pgFvs-TcDBAT containing the 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10 beta-O-acetyltransferase (DBAT) gene was constructed and transformed into the cells of F. velutipes by polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting analysis verified the successful integration of the exogenous DBAT gene into the genome of F. velutipes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme activity analyses confirmed that the DBAT gene was expressed in F. velutipes, and DBAT is able to convert substrate into baccatin III. CONCLUSION: The DBAT gene from the plant Taxus chinensis can be functionally expressed in F. velutipes. Transgenic F. velutipes expressing the DBAT gene is able to produce the target product, baccatin III. This is the first report about the transformation and expression of paclitaxel biosynthetic gene in the edible mushroom F. velutipes. This represents a significant step towards bio-production of paclitaxel and its advanced precursor baccatin III in an edible fungus. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry
3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 Computer aided design; Wind turbine blade; Skinning; Compatibility of section curves        	The design of horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) blades involves several geometric complexities. As a result, the modeling of these blades by commercial computer-aided design (CAD) software is not easily accomplished. In the present paper, the HAWT blade is divided into structural and aerodynamic surfaces with a G1 continuity imposed on their connecting region. The widely used method of skinning is employed throughout the current work for surface approximation. In addition, to ensure the compatibility of section curves, a novel approach is developed based on the redistribution of input airfoil points. In order to evaluate deviation errors, the Hausdorff metric is used. The fairness of surfaces is quantitatively assessed using the standard strain energy method. The above-mentioned algorithms are successfully integrated into a MATLAB program so as to enhance further optimization applications. The final surfaces created by the procedure developed during the present study can be exported using the IGES standard file format and directly interpreted by commercial CAD and FE, software.

5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 alcohol; diet; epidemiology; hormone replacement therapy; menopause; oral contraceptives; ovarian cancer; parity; protective factors; tobacco        	The present overview of ovarian cancer epidemiology summarizes the main results for a network of case-control studies in Italy and from the Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer. There are consistent inverse relations between parity, oral contraceptive use and the risk of ovarian cancer. For other menstrual and hormonal factors (i.e. early age at menarche and late menopause), there are established associations, but of limited impact on ovarian cancer incidence on a population level. Serous and endometrioid ovarian cancers (but not mucinous or clear cell types) are related to current and recent use of hormone replacement therapy in menopause. There are no strong associations with alcohol and tobacco overall, but a direct link for tobacco with (borderline) mucinous cancers, of limited impact, however, on overall ovarian cancer mortality. There are direct associations of ovarian cancer risk with height and BMI, as well as possible relations with selected dietary factors - in the absence, however, of consistent findings - and a possible inverse association with physical activity. There is a strong association with a family history of ovarian cancer (and a few selected other neoplasms, including colorectum and endometrium). Recognized risk factors explain only a limited proportion of ovarian cancer cases on a population level. A key reason for the recent favourable trends of ovarian cancer incidence and mortality in several high-income countries is the widespread use of oral contraceptive in the generations born after 1930.

5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 cardiovascular disease; haplogroup; metabolism; mitochondria; mitochondrial DNA; reactive oxygen species        	Purpose of review Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for more morbidity and mortality worldwide than any other ailment. Strategies for reducing CVD prevalence must involve identification of individuals at high risk for these diseases, and the prevention of its initial development. Such preventive efforts are currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the genetic determinants of CVD risk. In this review, evidence for the involvement of inherited mitochondrial mutations in development of CVD is examined. Recent findings Several forms of CVD have been documented in the presence of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, both in isolation and as part of larger syndromes. Other 'natural' mtDNA polymorphisms not overtly tied to any pathology have also been associated with alterations in mitochondrial function and individual risk for CVD, but until very recently these studies have been merely correlative. Fortunately, novel animal models are now allowing investigators to define a causal relationship between inherited 'natural' mtDNA polymorphisms, and cardiovascular function and pathology. Summary Cardiovascular involvement is highly prevalent among patients with pathogenic mtDNA mutations. The relationship between CVD susceptibility and 'natural' mtDNA polymorphisms requires further investigation, but will be aided in the near future by several novel experimental models.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 2D        	A decade old theory hypothesizes that brain exposure to androgens promotes involvement in criminal behavior. General support for this hypothesis has been provided by studies of postpubertal circulating levels of testosterone, at least among males. However, the theory also predicts that for both genders, prenatal androgens will be positively correlated with persistent offending, an idea for which no evidence currently exists. The present study used an indirect measure of prenatal androgen exposurethe relative length of the second and fourth fingers of the right hand (r2D:4D)to test the hypothesis that elevated prenatal androgens promote criminal tendencies later in life for males and females. Questionnaires were administered to 2,059 college students in Malaysia and 1,291 college students in the United States. Respondents reported their r2D:4D relative finger lengths along with involvement in 13 categories of delinquent and criminal acts. Statistically significant correlations between the commission of most types of offenses and r2D:4D ratios were found for males and females even after controlling for age. It is concluded that high exposure to androgens during prenatal development contributes to most forms of offending following the onset of puberty.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 environmental DNA; barcoding; metabarcoding; PCR; qPCR; high-throughput sequencing; primer design; biodiversity        	Environmental DNA (eDNA) comprises DNA fragments that have been shed into the environment by organisms, and which can be extracted from environmental samples such as water or soil. Characterization of eDNA can allow researchers to infer the presence or absence of species from a particular site without the need to locate and identify individuals, and therefore may provide an extremely valuable tool for quantifying biodiversity. However, as is often the case with relatively new protocols, methodological challenges remain. A number of earlier reviews have discussed these challenges, but none have provided extensive treatment of the critical decisions surrounding molecular markers and primer development for use in eDNA assays. This review discusses a number of options and approaches that can be used when determining which primers and gene regions are most appropriate for either targeted species detection or metabarcoding macro-organisms from eDNA. The latter represents a new field that is growing rapidly, and which has the potential to revolutionize future assessments of community and ecosystem diversity.
5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 primary progressive aphasia; executive functions; assessment; language impairment        	Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative condition in which the most prominent clinical feature is language difficulties. Other cognitive domains have been described to remain unaffected at the early stages of the disease and, therefore, excluded from diagnostic criteria. However, we show in this article that executive function (EF) disorders may be present in the 3 variants (nonfluent/agrammatic, logopenic, and semantic) of PPA. We also illustrate changes in language and EF by means of a 3-year behavioral and neuroimaging longitudinal study of a patient suffering from the semantic variant of PPA. This review provides an update on current knowledge of PPA, suggesting that dysexecutive symptoms may be encountered in the 3 PPA variants, in their early phases and/or in more advanced stages, when atrophy extends to adjacent brain areas.
5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 Anterior cruciate ligament; knee; Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score; quality of life        	The aim of our study was to cross-sectionally compare patient-reported knee function outcomes between people who chose non-surgical treatment for ACL injury and those who chose ACL reconstruction. We extracted Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and EuroQoL-5D data entered into the Swedish National ACL Registry by patients with a non-surgically treated ACL injury within 180days of injury (n=306), 1 (n=350), 2 (n=358), and 5years (n=114) after injury. These data were compared cross-sectionally to data collected pre-operatively (n=306) and at 1 (n=350), 2 (n=358), and 5years (n=114) post-operatively from age- and gender-matched groups of patients with primary ACL reconstruction. At the 1 and 2year comparisons, patients who chose surgical treatment reported superior quality of life and function in sports (1year mean difference 12.4 and 13.2 points, respectively; 2year mean difference 4.5 and 6.9 points, respectively) compared to those who chose non-surgical treatment. Patients who chose ACL reconstruction reported superior outcomes for knee symptoms and function, and in knee-specific and health-related quality of life, compared to patients who chose non-surgical treatment.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 Hydraulic models; Rigid water column model; Transient flow; Global gradient algorithm; Unsteady flow indicators; Pipe networks; Water distribution systems        	Many studies have aimed to characterize pressurized transient hydraulics. However, it remains difficult to assess the importance of dynamic effects in a robust manner, and modeling is further complicated by the tension between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. To address such challenges for incompressible flows, this article presents an adaptive modeling approach that combines a novel hybrid formulation, termed the hybrid global gradient algorithm (HGGA), with a variable time step (VTS). The HGGA combines the generalized and rigid water column global gradient algorithms, so it can adapt to inertially-dominated flows and those without such effects. Computational efficiency and physical accuracy are balanced by adjusting the formulation according to the simulated hydraulics. Three physically-based indicators are then introduced to characterize unsteady flow: these actively inform the HGGA of how to model a system. Two pipe networks are used to demonstrate the current work. The first illustrates the utility of the inertial indicators, and the second comprises an extended period simulation with the VTS scheme. Although more computationally intensive than conventional modeling, the methodology is shown to provide a better representation of dynamic hydraulics.

Ferromagnetic materials have nonlinear behavior and are widely used in stealth technology as absorbing coatings. Our objective is the derivation, the stability analysis, and the numerical approximation of effective boundary conditions that permit simulation, at least approximatively, of the effect of the thin layer, avoiding the discretization of Maxwells equations inside this layer.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Valinomycin; Nonribosomal peptides; Escherichia coli; Fed-batch cultivation; EnBase; EnPresso        	Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), a large family of natural products, possess numerous pharmaceutically significant bioactivities. However, many native microbial producers of NRPs are not cultivable or have low production yields making mass production infeasible. The recombinant production of natural products in a surrogate host has emerged as a strategy to overcome these limitations. De novo recombinant production of the NRP antibiotic valinomycin in an engineered Escherichia coli host strain was established with the necessary biosynthetic pathway constituents from Streptomyces tsusimaensis. In the present study, the initially modest valinomycin yields could be significantly increased from 0.3 up to 2.4 mg L-1 by switching from a batch to an enzyme-based fed-batch mode in shake flasks. A subsequent design of experiment-driven optimization of parallel fed-batch cultivations in 24-well plates with online monitoring of dissolved oxygen and pH led to valinomycin yields up to 6.4 mg L-1. Finally, repeated glucose polymer feeding to enzyme-based high cell density cultivations in shake flasks resulted in cell densities of OD600 >50 and a valinomycin titer of appr. 10 mg L-1. This represents a 33-fold improvement compared to the initial batch cultivations and is the highest concentration of a nonribosomal peptide which has been produced in E. coli without feeding of specific precursors so far to our knowledge. Also, such a small-scale optimization under fed-batch conditions may be generally applicable for the development and scale-up of natural product production processes in E. coli.
6	8	133	biochemistry 	 Southern blotting  	 Glycine max; Transgenic vegetable soybean; Phosphate transporter; Low phosphorus        	Low phosphorus (P) availability is a major constraint in the growth and production of vegetable soybean. To improve P efficiency in vegetable soybean, a rice (Oryza sativa L) phosphate transporter gene, OsPT6, was transferred into the vegetable soybean cultivar 'NY-1001' using an Agrobacterium-mediated cotyledonary-node transformation system. OsPT6 was driven by the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter in the binary vector pCAMBIA3301-OsPT6. Two independent fertile T-0 transgenic plants (12PT6-1 and 12PT6-2) were obtained and confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting analyses. The overexpression of the OsPT6 gene of the T-2 transgenic plants was detected by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The tolerance of the T-2 transgenic lines overexpressing OsPT6 to low concentrations of phosphate (low-Pi; 10 mu M Pi) was evaluated by hydroponic culture using a modified Hoagland's nutrient solution. The P contents in leaves, stems, and roots of the transgenic plants were significantly higher than those of the non-transformed (NT) plants under the concentrations of both low- and normal-Pi of standard Hoagland's nutrient solution. Under low-Pi stress, the transgenic plants grew better and exhibited significant increases in plant height, root length, root weight, number of pods and seeds, and seed weight per plant compared with the NT plants. Our data indicate that the overexpression of OsPT6 in transgenic vegetable soybean lines improves P accumulation and growth performance and thereby represents a promising approach for the improvement of P efficiency in vegetable soybean.

1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 multichannel readout electronics; application specific integrated circuits; analog-digital integrated circuits        	This paper presents architecture and simulation results of the analog part of a multichannel integrated circuit (IC) for optical radiation sensors (visible and infrared light) that can be used in high-speed applications. The complete prototype, called Optical Radiation Readout Circuit (ORRC) is composed of analog front end and moderate-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) included in every channel. This paper is focused on fast analog signal processing taking into account parameters such as pulse shaping, noise performance, and stability issues. The front-end part of the proposed IC is composed of a Charge Sensitive Amplifier (CSA) and an active filter (called shaper). The main design challenges related to high-repetition-rate signal processing are discussed in detail. The topology of the circuit is verified with a number of simulations including Monte Carlo sessions.
5	0	72	Medical 	 Addiction  	 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; ADHD; Heroin dependence; Methadone; Buprenorphine; Psychiatric symptoms        	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a risk for substance use disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between adult ADHD symptoms, opioid use disorder, life dysfunction and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. 1057 heroin dependent patients on opioid substitution treatment participated in the survey. All patients were screened for adult ADHD symptoms using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-v1.1). 19.4% of the patients screened positive for concurrent adult ADHD symptoms status and heroin dependence. Education level was lower among patients with ADHD symptoms, but not significant with respect to non-ADHD patients. Patients with greater ADHD symptoms severity were less likely to be employed. A positive association was observed between ADHD symptoms status and psychiatric symptoms. Patients with ADHD symptoms status were more likely to be smokers. Patients on methadone had a higher rate of ADHD symptoms status compared to buprenorphine. Those individuals prescribed psychoactive drugs were more likely to have ADHD symptoms. In conclusion, high rate of ADHD symptoms was found among heroin dependent patients, particularly those affected by the most severe form of addiction. These individuals had higher rates of unemployment, other co-morbid mental health conditions, heavy tobacco smoking. Additional psychopharmacological interventions targeting ADHD symptoms, other than opioid substitution, is a public health need.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 fluid mechanics; mathematical modelling; river engineering        	Laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale meandering compound channel to investigate the flow patterns at the apex and cross-over sections. An equation in curvilinear co-ordinates was derived from the momentum equation and the flow continuity equation. In this equation, two shear stress terms are ignored due to their negligible contributions such that simple expressions are obtained. Several groups of experimental data from the published literature were used to verify this model. Comparison of the experimental and predictive results indicates that the proposed method is capable of accurately forecasting the stage discharge in meandering compound channels. Finally, the simple analytical solution of this model and the velocity parameter are further discussed.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 3D X-ray microscopy; Transiliac biopsy; Menopause; Density; Lacunar volume        	This is the first study to examine clinical human bone specimens by three-dimensional imaging to characterize osteocyte lacunar properties as a function of macroanatomic bone type and estrogen loss. We applied laboratory-based instrumentation [3D X-ray microscope (3DXRM), MicroXCT-200; Carl Zeiss/Xradia, Inc.] that reaches the same resolution as synchrotron microscopy. We used serial transiliac bone biopsy specimens to examine the effect of macroanatomic bone type and estrogen status on osteocyte lacunar properties. These properties include lacunar size (volume, axes lengths of the ellipsoidal lacunar voids), distribution (density, average near-neighbor lacunar distance), and shape factors (sphericity ratio, average eigenvalues, degree of equancy, elongation, and flatness) in both cortical and trabecular bone tissue. The lacunar properties (volume, surface area, density, near-neighbor distance, etc.) and the shape factors (E1, L1, L2, degree of equancy, degree of elongation) were different between cortical and trabecular bone regardless of estrogen status. In cortical bone and trabecular nodes, the lacunar void volume and surface area were either smaller or tended to be smaller in postmenopausal as compared to premenopausal women. The void volume-to-bone volume ratio of cortical bone showed declining trends with estrogen loss. While there were differences between trabecular and cortical bone tissue, the lacunar void sphericity ratio for trabecular struts shows decreasing trends in postmenopausal women. These data suggest that using 3DXRM can provide new insight into osteocyte lacunar properties in transiliac bone biopsies from patients with various skeletal disease/conditions and pharmaceutical treatments.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Transformational leadership; transactional leadership; whistle-blowing attitudes        	The benefits of effective leadership practices have often been examined. However, little is known about how these practices impact the perceptions of agency employees regarding whistle-blowing. For instance, only two cross-sectional studies were found to examine an association between transformational leadership (the most often studied leadership practice) and whistle-blowing attitudes. To extend these studies, we examined the relationship between transformational-oriented leadership behaviours and whistle-blowing attitudes using panel data. The findings revealed that transformational-oriented leadership increased the extent to which employees in agencies felt they could disclose wrongdoing without facing retaliation. Transactional-oriented leadership was also found to have a positive effect on these whistle-blowing behaviours; however, the effect size was smaller. The implications of these findings are thoroughly discussed in the article.

0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 structure-preserving; symplectic precise integration; nose undercarriage; constraint default        	The main idea of the structure-preserving method is to preserve the intrinsic geometric properties of the continuous system as much as possible in numerical algorithm design. The geometric constraint in the multi-body systems, one of the difficulties in the numerical methods that are proposed for the multi-body systems, can also be regarded as a geometric property of the multi-body systems. Based on this idea, the symplectic precise integration method is applied in this paper to analyze the kinematics problem of folding and unfolding process of nose undercarriage. The Lagrange governing equation is established for the folding and unfolding process of nose undercarriage with the generalized defined displacements firstly. And then, the constrained Hamiltonian canonical form is derived from the Lagrange governing equation based on the Hamiltonian variational principle. Finally, the symplectic precise integration scheme is used to simulate the kinematics process of nose undercarriage during folding and unfolding described by the constrained Hamiltonian canonical formulation. From the numerical results, it can be concluded that the geometric constraint of the undercarriage system can be preserved well during the numerical simulation on the folding and unfolding process of undercarriage using the symplectic precise integration method.

Therapeutic treatments for breast cancer generally include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrinotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. With the development of molecular biology, immunology and pharmacogenomics, immunotherapy becomes a promising new field in breast cancer therapies. In this review, we discussed recent progress in breast cancer immunotherapy, including cancer vaccines, bispecific antibodies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several additional immunotherapy modalities in early stages of development are also highlighted. It is believed that these new immunotherapeutic strategies will ultimately change the current status of breast cancer therapies.
5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Human immunodeficiency virus; Nurse; Stigma        	Objectives: This study examined the factors associated with nurses' willingness to care for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) in Vietnam. Methods: A cross-section of 400 Vietnamese nurses from two hospitals were selected using stratified random sampling, to whom a self-administered questionnaire was administered which included demographic items, previous experience with patients infected with HIV or HBV/HCV, and their attitudes toward these patients. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression. Results: The lifetime prevalence of needlestick or sharps injury whilst caring for a patient infected with HIV or HBV/HCV was 9 and 15.8%, respectively. The majority of participants expressed a willingness to care for patients infected with HIV (55.8%) or HBV/HCV (73.3%). Willingness to care for HIV-infected patients was positively associated with being 40-49 years of age and confidence in protecting themselves against infection. Regarding HBV/HCV infection, willingness to care was positively associated with individual confidence in protecting themselves against infection. Conclusions: This study revealed that Vietnamese nurses were somewhat willing to care for patients infected with HIV or HBV/HCV, and this was associated with individual confidence in protecting themselves against infection and with negative attitudes towards HIV and HBV/HCV. Establishing a positive safety culture and providing appropriate professional education to help reduce the stigma towards infected patients offers an effective way forwards to improve quality of care in Vietnam, as elsewhere.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 pregnancy; birth defects; surveillance; Zika virus; monitoring        	Background: Zika virus is a newly recognized human teratogen; monitoring its impact on the birth prevalence of microcephaly and other adverse pregnancy outcomes will continue to be an urgent need in the United States and worldwide. Methods: When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) activated the Emergency Operations Center for the Zika virus outbreak response in January of 2016, public health leadership recognized that a joint, coordinated effort was required between activities focused on the effects of the infection among pregnant women and those focused on birth defects in fetuses and infants. Before the introduction of Zika virus in the Americas, population- based birth defects surveillance occurred independently of pregnancy surveillance activities. Results: The coordination of pregnancy surveillance and birth defects surveillance implemented through the CDC Zika virus response represents a paradigm shift. Conclusion: Coordination of these surveillance systems provides an opportunity to capture information from both a prospective and retrospective approach. This relatively modest investment in the public health infrastructure can continue to protect pregnant women and their infants during the ongoing response to Zika virus and in the next emergent threat to maternal and child health.

1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Obstacle avoidance system; Wheeled mobile robots; CMOS image sensor; Image channel weighting parameter method        	The purpose of this paper is to adopt CMOS image sensors to achieve a real-time obstacle avoidance system for wheeled mobile robots, so that the robot can continually detect surroundings, avoid obstacles, and move toward the target area. In this study, CMOS image sensor was used to detect small obstacles and obtain information concerning the environment in front of the robot. In order to avoid obstacles, the rolling speed and direction of the robot's left and right wheels were determined by the image channel weighting parameter method proposed in this study. The experimental results verified that image captured by a CMOS image sensor of the obstacle avoidance system of the wheeled mobile robot, which is combined with an ATMega162 embedded microcontroller, helps the robot avoid obstacles and reach the target area.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 Health policy; radiology; radiologists; Medicare; payment reform        	The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 advances the goal of tying Medicare payments to quality and value. In April 2016, CMS published an initial proposed rule for MACRA, renaming it the Quality Payment Program (QPP). Under QPP, clinicians receive payments through either advanced alternative payment models or the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), a consolidation of existing federal performance programs that applies positive or negative adjustments to fee-for-service payments. Most physicians will participate in MIPS. This review highlights implications of the QPP and MIPS for radiologists. Although MIPS incorporates radiology-specific quality measures, radiologists will also be required to participate in other practice improvement activities, including patient engagement. Recognizing physicians' unique practice patterns, MIPS will provide special considerations in performance evaluation for physicians with limited face-to-face patient interaction. Although such considerations will affect radiologists' likelihood of success under QPP, many practitioners will be ineligible for the considerations under currently proposed criteria. Reporting using qualified clinical data registries will benefit radiologists' performance by allowing expanded arrays of MIPS and non-MIPS specialty-specific measures. A group practice reporting option will substantially reduce administrative burden but introduce new challenges by requiring uniform determination of patient-facing status and performance measurement for all of the group's physicians (diagnostic radiologists, interventional radiologists, and nonradiologists) under the same taxpayer identification number. Given that the initial MIPS performance period begins in 2017, radiologists must begin preparing for QPP and taking actions to ensure their future success under this new quality-based payment system.

5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 Workplace; Immigrants; Racism; Australia; Occupational health and safety        	Immigrants are an important part of the Australian labor force and constitute a major source of net labor force growth. Immigrants arriving in Australia, however, face a number of barriers finding employment that is commensurate with their training and education (Reid, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health 36:120-125, 2012) and can end up in poor-quality jobs. Through a series of interviews and focus groups with newcomers, our study examined immigrants' experience of finding employment and their working conditions in Australia. In this manuscript, we specifically explore how discrimination shaped workers' experiences and the strategies workers used to overcome and deal with the barriers they encountered. We end with a discussion of how racism and its consequences can impact quality of work and worker health and safety.
0	5	5	CS 	 Computer graphics  	 Virtual Reality; Augmented Reality; Assembly; Marker; Task automation        	The study of the methodologies useful to support the assembly of parts is a challenging engineering task which can benefit of the most recent innovations in computer graphics and visualization technologies. This paper presents a proposal for an innovative methodology based on Virtual and Augmented Reality useful to support the components' assembly. The herein introduced strategy is based upon a four stages procedure: at first the designer conceives the assembly sequence using a CAD system, visualizing the scene wearing an immersive Virtual Reality device. In the second stage, the same sequence is developed by an un-experienced user using the same equipment: the differences between two assembly sequences are recorded and exploited to detect critical points in the assembly sequence and to develop a Knowledge Based System. Finally, a virtual user manual is produced in Augmented Reality. When the final user uses the tool, the position of the object to assemble is detected by tracking the finger position of the user itself. A series of symbols and writings is added to the external scene to help the end-user in the assembly procedure. A test case based on the assembly of a scale model has been developed to evaluate the methodology. After an evaluation process, the procedure seems to be feasible and presents some advantages over the state-of-the-art methodologies proposed by literature.
1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 DC geared motor; flex sensor; PID controller; open-loop; closed loop        	Hazardous environments such as in industry sector with high chemical usage give high risks to the safety of workers. These risks can be reduced by designing robotic hand that is able to replace human works. For the industry purpose, the robotic hand needs to have a higher performance in accuracy, stability and consistency. However, the current robotic hand in industry is not flexible, which means it cannot be used for different tasks. Therefore, a multipurpose robotic hand was developed. In this paper, the objectives of this research are to design and develop a PID controller for improving the performances of a robotic hand system. The experimental results prove that the PID controller shows good performances with the steady state error less than 0.11 degrees for the input reference, 30 degrees respectively.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 Suspension bridge; Saddle; Preoffsetting value; Newton-Raphson iteration method        	To seek a proper way to calculate the preoffsetting value of saddle on a suspension bridge, some influences of structural parameters on the preoffsetting are considered, then a new method for the preoffsetting value of saddle is proposed. On the basis of the relationship of the main cable and saddle, equilibrium equations, geometric equations, and physical equations are deduced. Then, the equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson iteration method to derive the Jacobian influence matrix of preoffsetting. For convergence of the numerical calculation, constraint conditions and the range of initial values are given. Through comparison of the measured value in a 1/30-scale model test and the calculated value, the reliability of the new method is confirmed. Finally, parametric analysis of preoffsetting shows that (1) with an increase of the saddle radius, saddle preoffsetting increases in the middle-span direction; (2) with increases of the side/middle-span and rise/span ratios, saddle preoffsetting increases in the side-span direction; (3) the influence of cable self-weight on saddle preoffsetting is negligible; (4) with an increase of unstressed cable length in the side span, saddle preoffsetting increases in the middle-span direction; and (5) with an increase of unstressed cable length in the middle span, saddle preoffsetting increases in the side-span direction.
5	2	74	Medical 	 Alzheimer's Disease  	 Traumatic brain injury; Total Tau; Tau phosphorylation; GFAP; Cellular prion protein; Cognition; Immunohistochemistry        	Studies in vivo and in vitro have suggested that the mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathogenesis is initiated by an interaction between the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta o). This PrPC-A beta o complex activates Fyn kinase which, in turn, hyperphosphorylates tau (P-Tau) resulting in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. AD transgenic mice lacking PrPC accumulate A beta, but show normal survival and no loss of spatial learning and memory suggesting that PrPC functions downstream of A beta o production but upstream of intracellular toxicity within neurons. Since AD and traumatic brain injury (TBI)linked chronic traumatic encephalopathy are tauopathies, we examined whether similar mechanistic pathways are responsible for both AD and TBI pathophysiologies. Using transgenic mice expressing different levels of PrPC, our studies investigated the influence and necessity of PrPC on biomarker (total-tau [T-Tau], P-Tau, GFAP) levels in brain and blood as measured biochemically following severe TBI in the form of severe closed head injury (sCHI). We found that following sCHI, increasing levels of T-Tau and P-Tau in the brain were associated with the PrPC expression levels. A similar relationship between PrPC expression and P-Tau levels following sCHI were found in blood in the absence of significant T-Tau changes. This effect was not seen with GFAP which increased within 24 h following sCHI and progressively decreased by the 7 day time point regardless of the PrPC expression levels. Changes in the levels of all biomarkers were independent of gender. We further enhanced and expanded the quantitation of brain biomarkers with correlative studies using immunohisochemistry. We also demonstrate that a TBI-induced calpain hyperactivation is not required for the generation of P-Tau. A relationship was demonstrated between the presence/absence of PrPC, the levels of P-Tau and cognitive dysfunction. Our studies suggest that PrPC is important in mediating TBI related pathology.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Candida rugosa lipase; deodorizer distillate; food additives; kinetics; phytosterol ester        	In this paper, cotton seed oil deodorizer distillate (CSODD), was recovered to obtain fatty acid sterol ester (FASE), which is one of the biological activated substances added as human therapeutic to lower cholesterol. Esterification reactions were carried out using Candida rugosa lipase as a catalyst, and the conversion of phytosterol was optimized using response surface methodology. The highest conversion (90.8 +/- 0.4%) was reached at 0.84 wt% enzyme load, 1: 25 solvent/CSODD mass ratio, and 44.2 degrees C after 12 H reaction. A kinetic model based on the reaction rate equation was developed to describe the reaction process. The activation energy of the reaction was calculated to be 56.9 kJ/mol and the derived kinetic parameters provided indispensable basics for further study. The optimization and kinetic research of synthesizing FASE from deodorizer distillate provided necessary information for the industrial applications in the near future. Experimental results showed that the proposed process is a promising alternative to recycle sterol esters from vegetable oil deodorizer distillates in a mild, efficient, and environmental friendly method.

1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 DG sources; clustering methods; fuzzy techniques; distribution systems        	This paper proposes a decision making methodology using clustering methods and fuzzy techniques to determine the optimal location of distributed generation sources into an electrical distribution system. Based on the operational characteristics (loss sensitivity factor and voltage values in nodes) first of all was found the optimal distribution network partitioning, using k-means clustering method and after that were used fuzzy techniques to determine the optimal location of the DG sources for an appropriate DG planning. The suggested method is tested on a 20 kV real rural distribution network with 91 nodes. The results demonstrate that the methodology can be successfully used to determine the optimal DG location into an electrical network without disrupting the proper operation of the entire system.
1	9	25	ECE 	 Electrical generator  	 piezoelectric; energy harvesting; power source; electrical generator        	This paper describes the development and construction of an energy harvesting device to provide a safe, reliable source of electrical energy onboard gravity-dropped weapons such as aerial bombs. The generators collect and store mechanical energy as the weapon falls away from the aircraft. Only after the weapon has fallen away from the aircraft is the stored mechanical energy released, generating electricity through a hybrid piezoelectric and electromagnetic generation method. The design, construction, and testing of the generator is discussed at length. Conceptual designs for integrating the described energy harvester alongside current and alternative sources of electrical power are also discussed.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 agro-biodiversity; food and nutrition security; resilience; sustainability; underutilised crops        	"Underutilised crops represent an important component of Southern Africa's agro-biodiversity that has potential to contribute to the region's post-2015 development discourse. We reviewed the potential of underutilised crops with respect to how they can contribute to topical challenges, such as food and nutrition security, human health and well-being, climate change adaptation, the environment, and employment creation in poor rural communities. The fact that underutilised crops are the product of generations of landrace agriculture supports the idea that they are resilient and adapted to the needs of farmers in marginal agricultural environments. In addition, underutilised crops are also seen as offering economic advantages due to their uniqueness, suitability to environments in which they are grown and low input requirements. In certain cases, underutilised crops are associated with specific gender roles with women being seen as particularly significant in their production. Evidence also suggests that the inclusion of underutilised crops in cropping systems contributes to dietary diversity and improved nutrition. In the context of the post-2015 agenda, the potential of underutilised crops to generate income, address food security and their status as a ""subset of biodiversity"" links with a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressing social, economic and environmental issues."
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 Substance abuse; HIV; Apathy; Impulsive behavior; Sensation        	"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and methamphetamine (MA) dependence are associated with neural injury preferentially involving frontostriatal circuits. Little is known, however, about how these commonly comorbid conditions impact behavioral presentations typically associated with frontal systems dysfunction. Our sample comprised 47 HIV-uninfected/MA-nondependent; 25 HIV-uninfected/MA-dependent; 36 HIV-infected/MA-nondependent; and 28 HIV-infected/MA-dependent subjects. Participants completed self-report measures of ""frontal systems"" behaviors, including impulsivity/disinhibition, sensation-seeking, and apathy. They also underwent comprehensive neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric assessments that allowed for detailed characterization of neurocognitive deficits and comorbid/premorbid conditions, including lifetime Mood and Substance Use Disorders, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder. Multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounds (i.e., demographics and comorbid/premorbid conditions) showed that MA dependence was independently associated with increased impulsivity/disinhibition, sensation-seeking and apathy, and HIV infection with greater apathy. However, we did not see synergistic/additive effects of HIV and MA on frontal systems behaviors. Global neurocognitive impairment was relatively independent of the frontal systems behaviors, which is consistent with the view that these constructs may have relatively separable biopsychosocial underpinnings. Future research should explore whether both neurocognitive impairment and frontal systems behaviors may independently contribute to everyday functioning outcomes relevant to HIV and MA.

3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 Ceramics; Phase diagrams; Titanium carbonitride; Stability domain; Thermodynamics        	Phase stability diagrams for the carbothermal reduction of a mixture of TiO2 and WO3 at 1500 K were constructed as a function of the carbon activity, oxygen pressure and characteristics of solution formation. Through this, it was found that the stable domains of carbides/carbonitrides, including (Ti,W)C/(Ti,W)(CN), are larger than the phases that are formed when solid-solution phases are not considered due to their greater stability. The use of a nitrogen atmosphere instead of vacuum expanded the stable domains of the solid-solution phases, indicating that they are made more stable under these conditions. Using these stability diagrams, the reaction sequence of carbothermal reduction can be predicted, and so this study can provide a guideline for preparing tougher carbide/carbonitride (Ti,W)C/(Ti,W)(CN) phases from TiO2/WO3 mixtures.

0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 best practices; heterogeneous software systems; interoperability; Semat        	Interoperability among heterogeneous software systems is a software quality sub-characteristic. Some methods for dealing with interoperability exhibit differences in aspects like generality, development method, and work products, among others. However, some authors understand interoperability as a non-functional requirement with general-purpose practices for identifying and specifying such requirement. Other authors assess and achieve interoperability by using work products falling beyond defined practices. Consequently, in this paper we propose four best practices in order to accomplish interoperability among heterogeneous software systems. Our best practices are represented with the Semat (Software Engineering Method and Theory) kernel, since it includes a language with simple and precise elements. Definition of interoperability best practices enables unification of the effort focused on software systems interoperability.
5	47	119	Medical 	 Rheumatoid Arthritis  	 nociception; cytokine; glial; PRC2; DZnep; GSK126        	Alteration in gene expression along the pain signaling pathway is a key mechanism contributing to the genesis of neuropathic pain. Accumulating studies have shown that epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in nociceptive process in the spinal dorsal horn. In this present study, we investigated the role of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, in the spinal dorsal horn in the genesis of neuropathic pain in rats induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase, which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 on K27 (H3K27), resulting in gene silencing. We found that levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27TM) in the spinal dorsal horn were increased in rats with neuropathic pain on day 3 and day 10 post nerve injuries. EZH2 was predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn under normal conditions. The number of neurons with EZH2 expression was increased after nerve injury. More strikingly, nerve injury drastically increased the number of microglia with EZH2 expression by more than sevenfold. Intrathecal injection of the EZH2 inhibitor attenuated the development and maintenance of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in rats with nerve injury. Such analgesic effects were concurrently associated with the reduced levels of EZH2, H3K27TM, lba1, GFAP, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and MCP-1 in the spinal dorsal horn in rats with nerve injury. Our results highly suggest that targeting the EZH2 signaling pathway could be an effective approach for the management of neuropathic pain. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 primary human microglia; characterization; responsiveness; models and cell lines        	The biology of microglia has become subject to intense study, as they are widely recognized as crucial determinants of normal and pathologic brain functioning. While they are well studied in animal models, it is still strongly debated what specifies most accurately the phenotype and functioning of microglia in the human brain. In this study, we therefore isolated microglia from postmortem human brain tissue of corpus callosum (CC) and frontal cortex (CTX). The cells were phenotyped for a panel of typical microglia markers and genes involved in myeloid cell biology. Furthermore, their response to pro-and anti-inflammatory stimuli was assessed. The microglia were compared to key human myeloid cell subsets, including monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and several commonly used microglial cell models. Protein and mRNA expression profiles partly differed between microglia isolated from CC and frontal cortex and were clearly distinct from other myeloid subsets. Microglia responded to both pro-(LPS or poly I:C) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 or dexa-methasone) stimuli. Interestingly, pro-inflammatory responses differed between microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages, as the former responded more strongly to poly I: C and the latter more strongly to LPS. Furthermore, we defined a large phenotypic discrepancy between primary human microglia and currently used microglial cell models and cell lines. In conclusion, we further delineated the unique and specific features that discriminate human microglia from other myeloid subsets, and we show that currently used cellular models only partly reflect the phenotype of primary human microglia.
5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 Antenatal care; Ethiopia; Pregnant women; Prevalence; Urinary incontinence        	Background: Urinary incontinence is defined as a complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine. During pregnancy, the prevalence of urinary incontinence ranges from 32 to 64 %. Different factors like demographic factors, obstetric factors, and other external factors affect urinary incontinence. In Ethiopia, there is no study conducted so far on the magnitude of urinary incontinence and factors associated among pregnant women. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence and associated factors among pregnant women following antenatal care at the University of Gondar Hospital. Methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 pregnant women following antenatal care at the University of Gondar Hospital. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were performed. The results were considered significant at p-value < 0.05. Result: The overall prevalence of urinary incontinence among the participants was 11.4 % [ 48]. After adjustment episiotomy, constipation, obese women, chronic cough/sneezing, asthma/allergies/sinusitis was associated with urinary incontinence. Conclusions: In this study, a lower prevalence was found than that of previous studies. There was a significant association of urinary incontinence with a previous history of episiotomy, constipation, maternal BMI, and respiratory problems.
5	28	100	Medical 	 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  	 Familial pulmonary fibrosis; High resolution computed tomography; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Pulmonary function tests        	Background: Familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) is defined as an idiopathic diffuse parenchymal lung disease affecting two or more members of the same primary biological family. The aim of the present study was to contribute to the clinical, functional and radiological characterisation of FPF with particular regards to disease progression and survival. Methods: Baseline clinical, functional and radiological data of a FPF population (n = 46 patients) were retrospectively collected and analysed according to the 2011 IPF guidelines HRCT classification. A PFT follow-up after 1-year and survival analysis was conducted among to different HRCT patterns. Results: 22 female and 24 male patients (age at diagnosis 58.5 +/- 9.7 years-old), belonging to 30 families, were included in this study. Radiological analysis demonstrated the presence of a UIP pattern at HRCT in 54.3% of patients, Poss-UIP in 21.8% and Incon-UIP in 23.9%. Incon-UIP patients were younger and more frequently female. Pulmonary function tests showed a restrictive ventilatory defect in patients with UIP and Incon-UIP patterns, while Poss-UIP patients had normal volumes with only a mild reduction of DLCO. BAL composition revealed increased lymphocytes percentage in Incon-UIP patients. Respiratory functional 1-year follow-up showed a significant worsening in UIP patients only. HRCT pattern progression was only demonstrated from Poss-UIP to UIP (18% of patients). Median survival was not statistically different among the 3 HRCT groups, although Poss-UIP patients presented a better outcome. Conclusions: FPF has been confirmed to be a complex condition with poor prognosis. The present study firstly analysed functional and radiological follow-up data of patients with FPF, showing that it may manifests with several HRCT patterns with different rates of progression, in which Possible UIP and UIP could be considered phases of the same disease and Inconsistent UIP patients may represent a different clinical and radiological condition.

5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 executive functions; cognitive skills; parenting; scaffolding; low- and middle-income countries        	The current study focuses on maternal cognitive capacities as determinants of parenting in a highly disadvantaged global context, where children's experiences at home are often the 1st and only opportunity for learning and intellectual growth. In a large sample of 1,291 biological mothers of preschoolaged children in rural Pakistan, we examined the unique association of maternal working memory skills (independent of related cognitive capacities) with cognitively stimulating parenting behaviors. Path analysis revealed that directly assessed working memory, short-term memory, and verbal intelligence independently predicted greater levels of observed maternal scaffolding behaviors. Mothers from poorer families demonstrated lower levels of working memory, short-term memory, and verbal intelligence. However, mothers' participation in an early childhood parenting intervention that ended 2 years prior to this study contributed to greater levels of working memory skills and verbal intelligence. Further, all 3 domains of maternal cognitive capacity mediated the effect of family economic resources on maternal scaffolding, and verbal intelligence also mediated the effect of early parenting intervention exposure on maternal scaffolding. The study demonstrates the unique relevance of maternal working memory for scaffolding behaviors that required continuously monitoring the child's engagement, providing assistance, and minimizing external distractions. These results highlight the importance of directly targeting maternal cognitive capacities in poor women with little or no formal education, using a 2-generation intervention approach that includes activities known to promote parental executive functioning and literacy.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 Cloud computing; Big Data; Geoprocessing; Distributed systems; Software architectures; Domain-specific languages        	In this paper we propose a software architecture that allows for processing of large geospatial data sets in the cloud. Our system is modular and flexible and supports multiple algorithm design paradigms such as MapReduce, in-memory computing or agent-based programming. It contains a web-based user interface where domain experts (e.g. GIS analysts or urban planners) can define high-level processing workflows using a domain-specific language (DSL). The workflows are passed through a number of components including a parser, interpreter, and a service called job manager. These components use declarative and procedural knowledge encoded in rules to generate a processing chain specifying the execution of the workflows on a given cloud infrastructure according to the constraints defined by the user. The job manager evaluates this chain, spawns processing services in the cloud and monitors them. The services communicate with each other through a distributed file system that is scalable and fault-tolerant. Compared to previous work describing cloud infrastructures and architectures we focus on the processing of big heterogeneous geospatial data. In addition to that, we do not rely on only one specific programming model or a certain cloud infrastructure but support several ones. Combined with the possibility to control the processing through DSL-based workflows, this makes our architecture very flexible and configurable. We do not only see the cloud as a means to store and distribute large data sets but also as a way to harness the processing power of distributed computing environments for large-volume geospatial data sets. The proposed architecture design has been developed for the IQmulus research project funded by the European Commission. The paper concludes with the evaluation results from applying our solution to two example workflows from this project. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 network security; steganography; covert channel; capacity; robustness        	In this paper, a novel covert channel, called covert behavior channel, is proposed according to behaviors of network users to solve the security and efficiency problem of the traditional covert channel. In the proposed channel, operation sequences of the network protocols are used as carriers of covert information. An encryption-based information embedding scheme is designed to improve security of the covert information. With the help of Markov model, the capacity of the proposed covert channel with time-varying noise is derived. The formulation for analyzing the covert behavior channel is presented against the channel noise aroused by discarding packets. By introducing corrected entropy-based algorithm to detect the covert behavior channel, the security of the channel is verified. Numerical results show that the proposed covert behavior channel is more secure than covert storage channels and achieves a better bit rate and robustness than that of covert timing channels.

5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 Postcoital Contraception; Sexual and Reproductive Health; Adolescent Health        	This study aimed to test how knowledge on emergency contraception (according to age at sexual initiation, type of school, and knowing someone that has already used emergency contraception) influences the method's use. This was a cross-sectional study in a probabilistic sample of students 15-19 years of age enrolled in public and private middle schools in a medium-sized city in Southeast Brazil (n = 307). Data were collected in 2011 using a self-administered questionnaire. A structural equations model was used for the data analysis. Considering age at sexual initiation and type of school, knowledge of emergency contraception was not associated with its use, but knowing someone that had used the method showed a significant mean effect on use of emergency contraception. Peer group conversations on emergency contraception appear to have greater influence on use of the method than knowledge itself, economic status, or sexual experience.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 CFS; Perceived stress; Cognitive behavioral stress management; Symptoms; Post-exertional malaise; Telehealth        	Objective: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) symptoms have been shown to be exacerbated by stress and ameliorated by group-based psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM). Still, patients may have difficulty attending face-to-face groups. This study compared the effects of a telephone-delivered (T-CBSM) vs a live (L-CBSM) group on perceived stress and symptomology in adults with CFS. Methods: Intervention data from 100 patients with CFS (mean age 50 years; 90% female) participating in T-CBSM (N = 56) or L-CBSM (N = 44) in previously conducted randomized clinical trials were obtained. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention symptom checklist scores were compared with repeated measures analyses of variance in adjusted and unadjusted analyses. Results: Participants across groups showed no differences in most demographic and illness variables at study entry and had similar session attendance. Both conditions showed significant reductions in PSS scores, with L-CBSM showing a large effect (partial epsilon(2) = 0.16) and T-CBSM a medium effect (partial epsilon(2) = 0.095). For CFS symptom frequency and severity scores, L-CBSM reported large effect size improvements (partial epsilon(2) = 0.19-0.23), while T-CBSM showed no significant changes over time. Conclusions: Two different formats for delivering group-based CBSM live and telephone showed reductions in perceived stress among patients with CFS. However, only the live format was associated with physical symptom improvements, with specific effects on post-exertional malaise, chills, fever, and restful sleep. The added value of the live group format is discussed, along with implications for future technology-facilitated group interventions in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 Robust adaptive beamforming; Similarity constraint; Quadratically constrained quadratic programming; Semidefinite programming        	In this paper, a procedure for the null broadening algorithm design with respect to the nonstationary interference is proposed. In contrast to previous works, we first impose nulls toward the regions of the nonstationary interference based on the reconstruction of the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix. Additionally, in order to provide a restriction on the shape of the beam pattern, a similarity constraint is enforced at the design stage. Then, the adaptive weight vector can be computed via maximizing a new signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion subject to similarity constraint. Mathematically, the design original problem is expressed as a nonconvex fractional quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem with additional constraint, which can be converted into a convex optimisation problem by semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. Finally, an optimal solution can be found by using the Charnes-Cooper transformation and the rank-one matrix decomposition theorem. Several numerical examples are performed to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 User interaction; Interaction techniques; Connected lighting; Lighting systems; Ambient display        	Light has a profound impact on the human body. Visually, light determines what aspects of our surroundings we can perceive and interpret. Non-visually, light contributes to regulating our physiology and psychology. Light is thus an unusual medium that can work both in and out of our conscious attention, and with new lighting technology this aspect is falling within our control. Computer controllable solid-state lighting has advanced such that they are now a commonplace technology in the world around us. While many of the characteristics of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting must fulfill the same requirements as lighting in the past, the ability to readily integrate LED technology into digital control systems presents exciting new opportunities that were not possible with other artificial light sources; for example, the potential to integrate the small form factor of an LED into the very fabric of a material or control them remotely over the Internet are aspects that set this technology apart from what has gone before. This unprecedented flexibility presents the opportunity for new functionality and novel interactive solutions for and with light. In this chapter, we present three categories of interactive lighting with many concrete examples: interacting with light at the center of our attention, interacting with light outside our attentional field, and interacting with light in the periphery of our attention. We conclude by considering the factors that make lighting a special medium for peripheral interaction and the role peripheral interaction can play in exposing the many new degrees of freedom ubiquitous digital lighting presents.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Analytics maturity; Analytics techniques; Organizational characteristics; Survey research        	The ability to derive new insights from data using advanced machine learning or analytics techniques can enhance the decision-making process in companies. Nevertheless, researchers have found that the actual application of analytics in companies is still in its initial stages. Therefore, this paper studies by means of a descriptive survey the application of analytics with regards to five different aspects as defined by the DELTA model: data, enterprise or organization, leadership, targets or techniques and applications, and the analysts who apply the techniques themselves. We found that the analytics organization in companies matures with regards to these aspects. As such, if companies started earlier with analytics, they apply nowadays more complex techniques such as neural networks, and more advanced applications such as HR analytics and predictive analytics. Moreover, analytics is differently propagated throughout companies as they mature with a larger focus on department-wide or organization-wide analytics and a more advanced data governance policy. Next, we research by means of clustering how these characteristics can indicate the analytics maturity stage of companies. As such, we discover four clusters with a clear growth path: no analytics, analytics bootstrappers, sustainable analytics adopters and disruptive analytics innovators. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Infections were usually frequent and severe during the early post-transplant period (first year). Recent diagnostic methods (molecular biology) and availability of new antivirals, antifungal and. antibiotic drugs made rapid diagnosis and systematic preventive strategies much easier and this resulted in a significant reduction of infections and infectious death in this population. However, new infectious agents like BK polyomavirus, hepatitis E virus, parvovirus (as well as Chigunkunya, West Nile and others in particular areas) were recently recognized as responsible of aggressive infections in the immunocompromised host. Malignancies are also common after transplantation, due to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression. Skin cancers and lymphoproliferative disorders are the most common and are undoubtedly caused by viral infections, but incidence of non-skin cancers is also increased. After reduction of immunosuppression, treatment is similar to non-transplant patients: Results are usually poor and cancer is now the third cause of death in transplant recipients. Due to their anti-proliferative and anti-tumoral properties, incidence of de novo cancer significantly decreased in patients receiving mTor inhibitors as maintenance immunosuppression; furthermore, in patients already diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma or recurrent skin cancers, introduction of mTor was associated with stabilisation and/or regression of malignant lesions.

6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 Organophosphate pesticides; Organophosphate metabolites; Human biomonitoring; Health effects; Knowledge score        	We used a combination of subjective (questionnaire) and objective (urinary metabolites) measurements to evaluate factors that can predict the exposure of farm workers in Qatar to organophosphate pesticides and to assess whether the levels of exposure are associated with any self-reported health outcomes. The results show that pesticides were being extensively mishandled in the farms. Very few (< 2%) of the farm workers knew the names of the pesticide they were using, and about one-third of the participants did not know the amount of pesticides to be applied to the crops. Nearly all (96%) of the participants had participated in mixing pesticides together before use and few (29%) used protective clothing while engaged in this operation. A significant number of participants (18%) had no knowledge that pesticides are a health hazard. At least one dialkyllphosphate (DAP) metabolite was detected in every worker. The geometric mean (GM) concentration of the dimethylalkylphosphates (DMAP) was 108 nM (range, from below the limit of detection (LOD) to 351 nM), and the GM for the diethylalkylphosphates (DEAP) was 43 nM (range, LOD-180 nM). The GM for total concentration of the metabolites (DAP) of 146 nM (maximum value estimated to be 531 nM) is below the values that have been reported for farmers in some countries, but higher than the levels in the general populations of many countries. We explored the influence of metal exposure and found consistent and negative relationships between the DAP metabolites and the concentrations of most of the trace elements in the urine of the farm workers; the negative associations were statistically significant for Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, As, and Pb. We suspect that the negative associations are not source-dependent but may be reflective of antagonistic relationships in human metabolism of OPPs and trace metals; hence we recommend that metals should be included as co-factors in assessing the health effects of OPP exposure.

0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 Alignment; Long-read sequencing; Genome structure; Repeat regions        	Background: Current development of sequencing technologies is towards generating longer and noisier reads. Evidently, accurate alignment of these reads play an important role in any downstream analysis. Similarly, reducing the overall cost of sequencing is related to the time consumption of the aligner. The tradeoff between accuracy and speed is the main challenge in designing long read aligners. Results: We propose Meta-aligner which aligns long and very long reads to the reference genome very efficiently and accurately. Meta-aligner incorporates available short/ long aligners as subcomponents and uses statistics from the reference genome to increase the performance. Meta-aligner estimates statistics from reads and the reference genome automatically. Meta-aligner is implemented in C++ and runs in popular POSIX-like operating systems such as Linux. Conclusions: Meta-aligner achieves high recall rates and precisions especially for long reads and high error rates. Also, it improves performance of alignment in the case of PacBio long-reads in comparison with traditional schemes.
0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 Associative memory; clique; power management; real-world data; twin neurons        	Associative memories are data structures that allow retrieval of previously stored messages given part of their content. They, thus, behave similarly to the human brain's memory that is capable, for instance, of retrieving the end of a song, given its beginning. Among different families of associative memories, sparse ones are known to provide the best efficiency (ratio of the number of bits stored to that of the bits used). Recently, a new family of sparse associative memories achieving almost optimal efficiency has been proposed. Their structure, relying on binary connections and neurons, induces a direct mapping between input messages and stored patterns. Nevertheless, it is well known that nonuniformity of the stored messages can lead to a dramatic decrease in performance. In this paper, we show the impact of nonuniformity on the performance of this recent model, and we exploit the structure of the model to improve its performance in practical applications, where data are not necessarily uniform. In order to approach the performance of networks with uniformly distributed messages presented in theoretical studies, twin neurons are introduced. To assess the adapted model, twin neurons are used with the real-world data to optimize power consumption of electronic circuits in practical test cases.
5	26	98	Medical 	 HIV/AIDS  	 HIV; Aids; Drug use patterns; Representative sample        	Background: Little is known about drug use patterns among people living with HIV in comparison to an uninfected group in the general population. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between legal and illegal drug use and HIV infection in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. Methods: Public use data files (2005-2014) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were used. Respondents were asked whether a medical professional had ever told them that they had HIV/AIDS. Ever (lifetime), past-year, and past month use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and nonmedical use of psychotherapeutics was assessed. Logistic regression Was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of the relationship between drug use and HIV infection, adjusting for demographics. Results: Of 377,787 respondents age 18 and older, 548 ( 0.19%) were categorized as HIV-infected. Ever use of cigarettes, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, and psychotherapeutics was higher in HIV infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected individuals after adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, total family income, and marital status. Past year and past month use was also higher for HIV-infected individuals for all substances aside from alcohol. Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample, there are higher levels of drug use and DSM-IV dependence among the HIV-infected population compared to the HIV-uninfected population. This is of concern because drug use and dependence can impede engagement in HIV care and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	32	104	Medical 	 Lymphoma  	 TNFAIP3/A20; linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex; OTULIN; haploinsufficiency of A20; LUBAC deficiency; otulipenia/otulin-related autoinflammatory syndrome        	Autoinflammatory diseases are caused by defects in genes that regulate the innate immunity. Recently, the scope of autoinflammation has been broadened to include diseases that result from dysregulations in protein modifications by the highly conserved ubiquitin (Ub) peptides. Thus far these diseases consist of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and OTULIN deficiencies, and haploinsufficiency of A20. The LUBAC is critical for linear ubiquitination of key signaling molecules in immune response pathways, while deubiquitinase enzymes, OTULIN and TNFAIP3/A20, reverse the effects of ubiquitination by hydrolyzing linear (Met1) and Lys63 (K63) Ub moieties, respectively, from conjugated proteins. Consequently, OTULIN or A20-deficient cells have an excess of Met1 or K63 Ub chains on NEMO, RIPK1, and other target substrates, which lead to constitutive activation of the NF-kappa B pathway. Mutant cells produce elevated levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and respond to therapy with cytokine inhibitors. Patients with an impairment in LUBAC stability have compromised NF-kappa B responses in non-immune cells such as fibroblasts, while their monocytes are hyperresponsive to IL-1 beta. Discoveries of germline mutations in enzymes that regulate protein modifications by Ub define a new category of autoinflammatory diseases caused by upregulations in the NF-kappa B signaling. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the latest developments in our understanding of the etiology of autoinflammation.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 Autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX); correlation coefficient index; oscillation damping control; subspace state space; subspace state-space system identification (N4SID); system identification; transfer function model; wide-area measurement system (WAMS)        	One of the main drawbacks of the existing oscillation damping controllers that are designed based on offline dynamic models is adaptivity to the power system operating condition. With the increasing availability of wide-area measurements and the rapid development of system identification techniques, it is possible to identify a measurement-based transfer function model online that can be used to tune the oscillation damping controller. Such a model could capture all dominant oscillation modes for adaptive and coordinated oscillation damping control. This paper describes a comprehensive approach to identify a low-order transfer function model of a power system using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) model. This methodology consists of five steps: 1) input selection; 2) output selection; 3) identification trigger; 4) model estimation; and 5) model validation. The proposed method is validated by using ambient data and ring-down data in the 16-machine 68-bus Northeast Power Coordinating Council system. The results demonstrate that the measurement-based model using MIMO ARMAX can capture all the dominant oscillation modes. Compared with the MIMO subspace state space model, the MIMO ARMAX model has equivalent accuracy but lower order and improved computational efficiency. The proposed model can be applied for adaptive and coordinated oscillation damping control.

Henna is very often admixed with para-phenylenediamine (PPDA) to improve the appearance of the tattoo. PPDA is a potent allergen, and is a frequent cause of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Material and method: A study was conducted on the results of 726 consecutive children who had been patch tested in the University General Hospital Consortium of Valencia between 1980 and 2015. Results: Almost half (49.7%; (361 cases) of the children had one or more positive patch test findings, with 4.7% (34) being allergic to PPDA. Mean age of patients allergic to PPDA was 12.4 years, and 44.2% were male. There were 2 cases (5.9%) of atopic dermatitis. Of the positive reactions, 73.5% were considered to be current clinically relevant. The sensitisation origin was a Henna tattoo in 50% of cases. Conclusion: PPDA sensitisation is relatively common in the child and adolescent population. The most frequent origin is the performing of Henna tattoos adulterated with PPDA. Adolescents are at the higher risk of developing ACD due to Henna tattoos. Henna tattooing should be strongly discouraged in children. (C) 2016 AsociaciOn Espanola de Pediatria.

1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 thermal control; temperature field; aircraft ECS; coupled simulation        	Commercial aircraft use environmental control systems (ECSs) to control the thermal environment in cabins and thus ensure passengers' safety, health, and comfort. This study investigated the interaction between ECS operation and cabin thermal environment. Simplified models were developed for the thermodynamic processes of the key ECS components in a commercial software program, ANSYS Simplorer. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, ANSYS Fluent, was employed to simulate the thermal environment in a cabin. Through the coupling of Simplorer and Fluent, a PID control method was applied to the aircraft ECS in Simplorer to achieve dynamic control of the temperature of the supply air to the cabin, which was used as a Fluent input. The calculated supply air temperature agreed with the corresponding experimental data obtained from an MD-82 aircraft on the ground. The coupled model was then used to simulate a complete flight for the purpose of studying the interaction between ECS operation and the cabin thermal environment. The results show that the PID controller in the ECS can maintain the cabin air temperature within +/- 0.6 K of the set point, with an acceptable air temperature distribution. The coupled models can be used for the design and analysis of the ECS and cabin thermal environment for commercial airplanes.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 zebrafish; wall shear stress; endothelial cells; blood-vessel network        	Physiological functions of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) vary depending on wall shear stress (WSS) magnitude, and the functional change affects the pathologies of various cardiovascular systems. Several in vitro and in vivo models have been used to investigate the functions of ECs under different WSS conditions. However, these models have technical limitations in precisely mimicking the physiological environments of ECs and monitoring temporal variations of ECs in detail. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) has several strategies to overcome these technical limitations, zebrafish cannot be used as a perfect animal model because applying various WSS conditions on blood vessels of zebrafish is difficult. This study proposes a new zebrafish model in which various WSS can be applied to the caudal vein. The WSS magnitude is controlled by blocking some parts of blood-vessel networks. The accuracy and reproducibility of the proposed method are validated using an equivalent circuit model of blood vessels in zebrafish. The proposed method is applied to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated zebrafish as a typical application. The proposed zebrafish model can be used as an in vivo animal model to investigate the relationship between WSS and EC physiology or WSS-induced cardiovascular diseases.

In this study the trueness of currently available milling devices was evaluated. Thirty clinical cases (ten inlays, ten crowns, ten onlays) were milled from ceramic blocks using four different milling approaches: five axis with IMES CORiTEC 450i, four axis with CEREC MCXL, four axis with CEREC MCXL-EF and five axis with inLab MCX5. The milled restorations were scanned and the occlusal and inner surfaces compared to the originally calculated 3D surface using difference analysis software. The (90-10 %) / 2 percentile of the distances were calculated and analysed using one-way ANOVA with the post hoc Scheff, test (alpha = 0.05). Chipping of marginal areas were visually examined and analysed using one-way ANOVA with a post hoc Tamhane test (alpha = 0.05). At inner surfaces, the milling trueness of IMES (33.9 +/- 16.3 mu m), X5 (32.3 +/- 9.7 mu m) and MCXL-EF (34.4 +/- 7.5 mu m) was significantly better (p < 0.001) than that of MCXL (62.1 +/- 17.1 mu m). At occlusal surfaces, MCXL-EF (25.7 +/- 9.3 mu m) showed significant higher accuracy (p < 0.001) than MCXL (48.7 +/- 23.3 mu m) and X5 (40.9 +/- 20.4 mu m). IMES produced the most chipping (p < 0.001). Five-axis milling devices yield high trueness. MCXL-EF is competitive and may allow chairside fabrication with good milling results. Accurate milling is required for well-fitting restorations and thereby requires fewer manual finishing steps, yields smaller marginal gaps, resistance to secondary caries and longevity of restorations.

6	8	133	biochemistry 	 Southern blotting  	 telomerase; hTERT; promoter methylation; colorectal cancer; telomere length        	Colorectal cancers exhibit a high telomerase activity, usually correlated with the hypermethylation of the promoter of its hTERT catalytic subunit. Although telomerase is not expressed in normal tissue, certain proliferative somatic cells such as intestinal crypt cells have demonstrated telomerase activity. The aim of this study was to determine whether a correlation exists between telomerase activity, levels of hTERT methylation and telomere length in tumoral and normal colorectal tissues. Tumor, transitional and normal tissues were obtained from 11 patients with a colorectal cancer. After bisulfite modification of genomic DNA, hTERT promoter methylation was analyzed by methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA). Telomerase activity and telomere length were measured by a fluorescent-telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay and by Southern blotting, respectively. A significant increase of hTERT methylation and telomerase activity, and a reduction of the mean telomere length were observed in the tumor tissues compared to the transitional and normal mucosa. In the transitional and normal mucosa, telomerase activity was significantly lower than that in tumor tissues, even with high levels of hTERT methylation. Nevertheless, hTERT promoter methylation was not linearly correlated to telomerase activity. These data indicate that hTERT promoter methylation is a necessary event for hTERT expression, as is telomerase activity. However, methylation is not sufficient for hTERT activation, particularly in normal colorectal cells.

Aim: The recent publication is an analysis of the data of registered essential thrombocythaemic patients. Method: an online electronic registry has been established, using 2008 World Health Organization's diagnostic criteria and thrombotic risk was evaluated according to Landolfi stratification. Results: Data of 350 essential thrombocythaemic patients from 15 Hungarian hematology centers entered up to the date of June 30, 2015 were used for analysis. Patients were followed up to (median) 6 years. The epidemiologic data (age, gender) and thrombotic events prior and after the diagnosis, were similar to the literature. The thrombotic events of anagrelide treated patient (n = 139) and the hydroxyurea + aspirin treated patients (n = 141) have been compared. The major arterial and venous events were similar between the groups, but there were fivefold less minor arterial and venous events in the anagrelide group (p < 0.001). Thrombotic incidence after diagnosis were influenced only by medication and thrombotic events before the diagnosis. Conclusions: Anagrelide significantly decreased the number of patients experiencing minor arterial and minor venous thrombosis, vs hydroxyurea + aspirin. Despite of the treatment the risk of thrombotic events after diagnosis remained high, and was significantly increased in patients with thrombosis before diagnosis.
5	43	115	Medical 	 Parkinson's Disease  	 optic nerve; retinal ganglion cells; melanopsin; circadian rhythms; Parkinson's disease; Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease        	There is increasing awareness on the role played by circadian rhythm abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The characterization of the circadian dysfunction parallels the mounting evidence that the hallmarks of neurodegeneration also affect the retina and frequently lead to loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and to different degrees of optic neuropathy. In the RGC population, there is the subgroup of cells intrinsically photosensitive and expressing the photopigment melanopsin [melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs)], which are now well known to drive the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the light-dark cycles. Thus, the correlation between the pathological changes affecting the retina and mRGCs with the circadian imbalance in these neurodegenerative diseases is now clearly emerging, pointing to the possibility that these patients might be amenable to and benefit from light therapy. Currently, this connection is better established for AD and PD, but the same scenario may apply to other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease. This review highlights similarities and differences in the retinal/circadian rhythm axis in these neurodegenerative diseases posing a working frame for future studies.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Infertility; Fertility treatments; Contraception; Folic acid; Fetal loss; Childhood leukemia        	To investigate the potential involvement of fertility treatments and other conditions of becoming pregnant (infertility, getting pregnant on birth control, maternal history of fetal loss) and folic acid supplements in the etiology of childhood leukemia (CL). The ESTELLE study included 747 cases of CL [636 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 100 of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)] diagnosed in France in 2010-2011 and 1,421 population controls frequency-matched with the cases on age and gender. Data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires administered to mothers. The odds ratios (OR) and their 95 % confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. CL was not associated with difficulty in becoming pregnant [OR 0.9 (0.7-1.2)], in vitro fertilisation [OR 0.6 (0.3-1.5)] or the use of any fertility treatment [OR 0.8 (0.5-1.1)] for the index pregnancy. CL was not significantly associated with becoming pregnant on contraception [OR 1.2 (0.8-1.8)], but a positive association was observed for third generation oral contraception [OR 4.3 (1.2-16.2)]; however, the result is based on small numbers. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with CL, but an inverse borderline association was observed for supplementation initiated in the 3 months preceding pregnancy [OR 0.7 (0.5-1.0)]. In addition, maternal histories of stillbirth and miscarriage were associated with ALL [OR 2.6 (1.1-5.9)] and AML [OR 1.8 (1.1-2.8)], respectively. The findings do not suggest that infertility and fertility treatments are risk factors for CL. They suggest that maternal histories of stillbirth and miscarriage may be more frequent among mothers of CL cases and that folic acid supplementation during preconception may reduce the risk of CL.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 social dilemmas; stereotypes; cooperation; prisoner's dilemma; culture        	In a globalized world, establishing successful cooperation between people from different nations is becoming increasingly important. We present results from a comprehensive investigation of cross-societal cooperation in one-shot prisoner's dilemmas involving population-representative samples from six countries and identify crucial facilitators of and obstacles to cooperation. In interactions involving mutual knowledge about only the other players' nationalities, we demonstrate that people hold strong and transnationally shared expectations (i.e., stereotypes) concerning the cooperation level of interaction partners from other countries. These expectations are the strongest determinants of participant cooperation. Paradoxically, however, they turn out to be incorrect stereotypes that even correlate negatively with reality. In addition to erroneous expectations, participants' cooperation behavior is driven by (shared) social preferences that vary according to the interaction partner's nationality. In the cross-societal context, these social preferences are influenced by differences in wealth and ingroup favoritism, as well as effects of specific country combinations but not by spatial distance between nations.
2	10	43	Psychology  	 Schizophrenia  	 cognition; physical exercise; RCT; schizophrenia; yoga        	Background: Yoga and physical exercise have been used as adjunctive intervention for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (SZ), but controlled comparisons are lacking. Aims: A single-blind randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether yoga training or physical exercise training enhance cognitive functions in SZ, based on a prior pilot study. Methods: Consenting, clinically stable, adult outpatients with SZ (n=286) completed baseline assessments and were randomised to treatment as usual (TAU), supervised yoga training with TAU (YT) or supervised physical exercise training with TAU (PE). Based on the pilot study, the primary outcome measure was speed index for the cognitive domain of attention' in the Penn computerised neurocognitive battery. Using mixed models and contrasts, cognitive functions at baseline, 21 days (end of training), 3 and 6 months post-training were evaluated with intention-to-treat paradigm. Results: Speed index of attention domain in the YT group showed greater improvement than PE at 6 months follow-up (p<0.036, effect size 0.51). In the PE group, accuracy index of attention domain showed greater improvement than TAU alone at 6-month follow-up (p<0.025, effect size 0.61). For several other cognitive domains, significant improvements were observed with YT or PE compared with TAU alone (p<0.05, effect sizes 0.30-1.97). Conclusions: Both YT and PE improved attention and additional cognitive domains well past the training period, supporting our prior reported beneficial effect of YT on speed index of attention domain. As adjuncts, YT or PE can benefit individuals with SZ.
2	10	43	Psychology  	 Schizophrenia  	 Bipolar disorder; white blood cells; immune system; symptom severity; gender differences        	Objective: Immune alterations may play a role in bipolar disorder etiology; however, the relationship between overall immune system functioning and mood symptom severity is unknown. Methods: The two comparative effectiveness trials, the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiatives in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder Study (Bipolar CHOICE) and the Lithium Treatment Moderate-Dose Use Study (LITMUS), were similar trials among patients with bipolar disorder. At study entry, white blood cell count and bipolar mood symptom severity (via Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale) were assessed. We performed analysis of variance and linear regression analyses to investigate relationships between deviations from median white blood cell and multinomial regression analysis between higher and lower white blood cell levels. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Results: Among 482 Bipolar CHOICE participants, for each 1.0 X 10(9)/L white blood cell deviation, the overall Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale severity increased significantly among men (coefficient=2.13; 95% confidence interval = [0.46, -3.79]; p = 0.013), but not among women (coefficient= 0.87; 95% confidence interval = [-0.87, -2.61]; p = 0.33). Interaction analyses showed a trend toward greater Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale symptom severity among men (coefficient= 1.51; 95% confidence interval=[-0.81, -3.82]; p = 0.2). Among 283 LITMUS participants, higher deviation from the median white blood cell showed a trend toward higher Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale scores among men (coefficient= 1.33; 95% confidence interval=[-0.22, -2.89]; p = 0.09), but not among women (coefficient = 0.34; 95% confidence interval = [-0.64, -1.32]; p = 0.50). When combining LiTMUS and Bipolar CHOICE, Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale scores increased significantly among men (coefficient= 1.09; 95% confidence interval = [0.31, -1.87]; p = 0.006) for each 1.0 X 10(9)/L. white blood cell deviation, whereas we found a weak association among women (coefficient= 0.55; 95% confidence interval = [-0.20, -1.29]; p = 0.14). Lower and higher white blood cell levels correlated with greater symptom severity and specific symptoms, varying according to gender. Conclusion: Deviations in an overall immune system marker, even within the normal white blood cell range, correlated with mood symptom severity in bipolar disorder, mostly among males. Studies are warranted investigating whether white blood cell count may predict response to mood-stabilizing treatment.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Aversive conditioning; Extinction; Reinstatement; Development; Children; Adolescents        	This study investigated developmental differences in aversive conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement (i.e., the recovery of conditioned aversive associations following reexposure to the unconditioned stimulus [US] post-extinction). This study examined these mechanisms in children (M-age = 8.8 years), adolescents (M-age = 16.1 years), and adults (M-age = 32.3 years) using differential aversive conditioning with a geometric shape conditional stimulus (CS+) paired with an aversive sound US and another shape (CS-) presented alone. Following an extinction phase in which both CSs were presented alone, half of the participants in each age group received three US exposures (reinstatement condition) and the other half did not (control condition), followed by all participants completing an extinction retest phase on the same day. Findings indicated (a) significant differences in generalizing aversive expectancies to safe stimuli during conditioning and extinction that persisted during retest in children relative to adults and adolescents, (b) significantly less positive CS reevaluations during extinction that persisted during retest in adolescents relative to adults and children, and (c) reinstatement of US expectancies to the CS+ relative to the CS- in all age groups. Results suggest important differences in stimulus safety learning in children and stimulus valence reevaluation in adolescents relative to adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 oncology nurse; stress level; stressful factor; coping behaviors        	Background: Oncology nursing is often a source of substantial stress for nurses. Many nurses, particularly novice nurses, have inadequate preparation to care for patients at the end of life and their families. Unless nurses prevent or manage work-related stress by using effective coping strategies, oncology nursing staff will continue to suffer from burnout and compassion fatigue. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to identify stress levels and stressful factors of nurses working in oncology outpatient units and to explore coping behaviors for work-related stress of oncology staff nurses in outpatient units. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to identify stress levels and stressful factors for outpatient oncology nurses, investigate differences in stress levels among nurses' demographic characteristics, and explore coping behaviors of the nurses. Study participants (N = 40) included RNs and licensed practical nurses who completed the Nursing Stress Scale, three open-ended questions, and a demographic questionnaire. Findings: The highest sources of stress were workload and patient death and dying. Demographic variables of age and work experience in nursing showed a significant positive relationship to work-related stress scores. The three most frequently used coping behaviors were verbalizing, exercising or relaxing, and taking time for self. Continuing education programs on stress management are highly recommended. Outpatient oncology nurses should be nurtured and supported through tailored interventions at multiple levels to help them find effective coping strategies and develop self-care competencies. Although younger and less experienced nurses had lower mean stress scores than older and more experienced nurses, the continuing education programs and tailored interventions would be helpful for all oncology nursing staff.

The recent demonstration that far from being benign, ""benign"" pro static hypertrophy is a likely a reaction of the prostate to chronic untreated lower genital tract infection, and that this chronic inflammation is likely the usual precursor to the frequent occurrence of prostatic carcinoma has far reaching implications. The obvious source for the chronic inflammatory stimulus in the prostate is the documented dramatically altered lower female genital microbiota associated with the menopause. Hence the major hypothesis is that prostatic cancer may arise due to chronic infection and inflammation in the prostate gland consequent upon the altered microbiome of the menopausal female genital tract. This has implications for testing and diagnosis, treatment, population health and personal hygiene practices. It suggests that male dyspareunia, although almost never encountered in clinical practice may in fact be relatively common in older males, and in particular if diagnosed, represents a critical opportunity for therapeutic intervention to interrupt the chronic inflammation cancer transformation and progression which has been well documented in other tissues. It implies that the coordinated application of next generation sequencing to the microbiome of the lower genital tracts of male and female couples, including seminal fluid, will have both research applications to further explore this. sequence, as well as finding application as a potential population level screening procedure as is presently done for the ""Thin Prep"" cervical screening for human papillomavirus in females. Moreover this insight opens up new opportunities for chemointervention and chemoprevention for this important clnicopathological progression. These considerations give rise to the exciting possibility that prostatic malignancy may be preventable by various methods of local hygiene in the female partner or some antibacterial method in males. Since the long term application of oral antibiotics is likely to be of limited efficacy this indicates the need for new antimicrobial solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
5	28	100	Medical 	 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  	 extracellular matrix; lung; collagen; myofibroblast; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; niche; fibrosis        	The lung is composed of airways and lung parenchyma, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) contains the main building blocks of both components. The ECM provides physical support and stability to the lung, and as such it has in the past been regarded as an inert structure. More recent research has provided novel insights revealing that the ECM is also a bioactive environment that orchestrates the cellular responses in its environs. Changes in the ECM in the airway or parenchymal tissues are now recognized in the pathological profiles of many respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Only recently have we begun to investigate whether these ECM changes result from the disease process, or whether they constitute a driving factor that orchestrates the pathological outcomes. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the alterations in the ECM in asthma, COPD, and IPF, and the contributions of these alterations to the pathologies. Emerging data suggest that alterations in the composition, folding or rigidity of ECM proteins may alter the functional responses of cells within their environs, and in so doing change the pathological outcomes. These characteristics highlight potential avenues for targeting lung pathologies in the future. This may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of chronic lung diseases, and novel approaches for finding therapeutic solutions. (c) 2016 The Authors.

0	6	6	CS 	 Image processing  	 Artificial bee colony; Clustering; K-means; Particle swarm optimization        	In the field of data analysis, clustering is a powerful technique which groups the data into different subsets using a distance function. Data belonging to the same subset are similar in nature and offer heterogeneity to the data that reside in other subsets. Clustering has proved its potentiality in various fields such as bioinformatics, pattern recognition, image processing and many more. In this paper, a two-step artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed for efficient data clustering. In two-step ABC algorithm, the initial positions of food sources are identified using the K-means algorithm instead of random initialization. Along this, to discover the promising search areas, an improved solution search equation based on social behavior of PSO is applied in the onlooker bee phase of ABC algorithm and abandoned food source location is found by using Hooke and Jeeves-based direct search method. Five benchmark and two artificial datasets are applied to validate the proposed modifications in the ABC algorithm, and results of this study are compared with other well-known clustering algorithms. Both the experimental and statistical analyses show that improvements in ABC algorithm have an advantage over the conventional ABC algorithm for solving clustering problems.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 essential hypertension; Kazak Chinese; Han Chinese; connexin genes; single nucleotide polymorphism        	Essential hypertension (EH) is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. The polymorphism of connexin (Cx) genes is found associated with the development of hypertension. However, the association of the polymorphism of Cxs with EH has not been investigated. This study aimed to investigate the association of the polymorphism of connexin (Cx) genes Cx37, Cx40, and Cx43 with EH in Kazak and Han Chinese in Xinjiang, China. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) were used to analyze the polymorphism of Cx genes in Kazak and Han EH patients as well as their normotensive controls. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the frequencies of different three genotypes (A/A, A/G, and G/G) and A and G alleles of Cx40 rs35594137 and rs11552588 between EH patients and normotensive controls. However, in Kazak EH patients, the frequencies of three genotypes (A/A, A/G, and G/G) of Cx37 rs1630310 were 24.8%, 47.2% and 28.0%, respectively, which were significantly different from those in Han EH patients. In Han EH patients, the frequencies of the three genotypes (C/C, C/G and G/G) of Cx43 rs1925223 were 6.4%, 35.6% and 58.0%, respectively. Frequencies of the other four genotypes had no statistical differences among Kazak and Han EH patients and their normotensive controls. These results suggest polymorphisms of Cx37 rs1630310 and Cx43 rs1925223 genes may be associated with the pathogenesis of EH. Carrying Cx37 rs1630310-A or Cx43 rs1925223-G genotypes may protect against the development of EH.

How is research about the media portrayed by those responsible for reporting objective findings? This article summarizes the efforts of the American Psychological Association's Public Policy Office on violence in the media in the late 1990s.

5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 Scalp metastasis; Scalp cooling; Breast cancer        	The risk of scalp metastases in patients using scalp cooling for preservation of hair during chemotherapy has been a concern but is poorly described. A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies was undertaken to evaluate the effect of scalp cooling versus no scalp cooling on the risk of scalp metastasis in patients treated for breast cancer with chemotherapy. Electronic databases, journal specific, and hand searches of articles identified were searched. Patients were matched based on disease, treatment, lack of metastatic disease, and sex. A total of 24 full-text articles were identified for review. Of these articles, ten quantified the incidence of scalp metastasis with scalp cooling over time. For scalp cooling, 1959 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 43.1 months. For no scalp cooling, 1238 patients were evaluated over an estimated mean time frame of 87.4 months. The incidence rate of scalp metastasis in the scalp cooling group versus the no scalp cooling group was 0.61% (95% CI 0.32-1.1%) versus 0.41% (95% CI 0.13-0.94%); P = 0.43. The incidence of scalp metastases was low regardless of scalp cooling. This analysis suggests that scalp cooling does not increase the incidence of scalp metastases.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Big data; Computational cost; Resampling; Subsampling        	The bootstrap is a popular and powerful method for assessing precision of estimators and inferential methods. However, for massive datasets that are increasingly prevalent, the bootstrap becomes prohibitively costly in computation and its feasibility is questionable even with modern parallel computing platforms. Recently, Kleiner and co-authors, proposed a method called BLB (bag of little bootstraps) for massive data, which is more computationally scalable with little sacrifice of statistical accuracy. Building on BLB and the idea of fast double bootstrap, we propose a new resampling method, the subsampled double bootstrap, for both independent data and time series data. We establish consistency of the subsampled double bootstrap under mild conditions for both independent and dependent cases. Methodologically, the subsampled double bootstrap is superior to BLB in terms of running time, more sample coverage, and automatic implementation with less tuning parameters for a given time budget. Its advantage relative to BLB and bootstrap is also demonstrated in numerical simulations and a data illustration. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.
5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 Nanoscale metal organic frameworks; Upconversion; Folic acid; Triple negative breast cancers; pH responsive release        	Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 lacking triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are the leading cause of death. The successful transport of chemotherapeutics in TNBC with receptor mediated targeting and image guided treatment is a serious challenge for cancer therapy. In this work, folic acid encapsulated nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOFs) is developed on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a targeted and pH responsive anticancer drug carrier. To construct the assembled core-shell drug delivery system (DDS), NaYF4: Yb3+, Er3+ is taken as UCNPs for its outstanding luminescence properties, then a folic acid encapsulated NMOFs based on tetravalent metal Zr (IV) is directly developed on UCNPs [labeled as UCNP@UIO-66(NH2)/FA]. Excitingly, UCNP@UI0-66(NH2)/FA are nontoxic towards TNBC cells (MDA-MB-468) and normal cell lines (NIH3T3). The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) is encapsulated into UCNP@UIO-66(NH2)/FA with high drug loading efficiency (1.42 g DOX per g NMOFs) and shows pH responsive drug release. The DOX loaded UCNP@UI0-66(NH2)/FA successfully enters into the MDA-MB-468 cells through a folate receptor mediated endocytosis and exhibits a higher cytotoxicity than normal cells. Flow cytometry and nuclear apoptosis studies suggest the present DDS can be potential applicable in breast cancer therapy to reduce the side effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 Hospital readmission; Pediatric spine deformity; Scoliosis; Spine fusion; Spine surgery; Unplanned readmissions        	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Short-term readmission rates are becoming widely used as a quality and performance metric for hospitals. Data on unplanned short-term readmission after spine fusion for deformity in pediatric patients are limited. PURPOSE: To characterize the rate and risk factors for short-term readmission after spine fusion for deformity in pediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Data were obtained from the State Inpatient Database from NewYork, Utah, Nebraska, Florida, North Carolina (years 2006-2010), and California (years 2006-2011). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included 30- and 90-day readmission rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria were patients aged 0-21 years, a primary diagnosis of spine deformity, and a primary 3+-level lumbar or thoracic fusion. Exclusion criteria included revision surgery at index admission and cervical fusion. Readmission rates were calculated and logistic analyses were used to identify independent predictors of readmission. RESULTS: There were a total of 13,287 patients with a median age of 14 years. Sixty-seven percent were girls. The overall 30and 90-day readmission rates were 4.7% and 6.1%. The most common reasons for readmission were infection (38% at 30 days and 33% at 90 days), wound dehiscence (19% and 17%), and pulmonary complications (12% and 13%). On multivariate analysis, predictors of 30-day readmission included male sex (p=.008), neuromuscular (p<.0001) or congenital scoliosis (p=.006), Scheuermann kyphosis (p=.003), Medicaid insurance (p<.0001), length of stay of= 6 days (p80 operations/year was associated with a 34% reduced risk of 30-day readmission (95% confidence interval 12%-50%, p=.005) compared with hospitals performing <20 operations/year. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term readmission rate for pediatric spine deformity surgery is driven by patient-related factors, as well as several risk factors that may be modified to reduce this rate.

3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 B-H curve; electrical machine; ferromagnetic materials; high temperature; induction motor; iron loss; magnetic properties; transformer        	The magnetic properties of ferromagnetic cores and the resistance of conductors are severely affected by the high operating temperatures in modern electrical machines. These temperature effects must be taken into account in the electrical machine design process to optimize their performance. In this work, we have proposed a simple material model to predict the change in the single-valued B-H relationship of non-oriented electrical steel with respect to the temperature. The temperature dependent power loss curves have also been measured and are fitted to a two term iron loss formula to compute the magnetic losses. The temperature dependent magnetic properties (B-H relationship and power loss formula) and the resistivity values of the conductors have then been incorporated into the Finite Element (FE) based computer simulations of a transformer core and an induction machine. The effects of temperature on different performance parameters, such as magnetic and copper losses and supply current have been studied.

5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 calcification; epicardial fat; menopause; paracardial fat        	Background-Volumes of paracardial adipose tissue (PAT) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) are greater after menopause. Interestingly, PAT but not EAT is associated with estradiol decline, suggesting a potential role of menopause in PAT accumulation. We assessed whether volumes of heart fat depot (EAT and PAT) were associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in women at midlife and whether these associations were modified by menopausal status and estradiol levels. Methods and Results-EAT and PAT volumes and CAC were measured using electron beam computed tomography scans. CAC was evaluated as (1) the presence of CAC (CAC Agatston score >= 10) and (2) the extent of any CAC (log CAC Agatston score >0). The study included 478 women aged 50.9 years (58% pre-or early perimenopausal, 10% late perimenopausal, and 32% postmenopausal). EAT was significantly associated with CAC measures, and these associations were not modified by menopausal status or estradiol. In contrast, associations between PAT and CAC measures were modified by menopausal status (interaction-P <= 0.01). Independent of study covariates including other adiposity measures, each 1-SD unit increase in log PAT was associated with 102% higher risk of CAC presence (P=0.04) and an 80% increase in CAC extent (P=0.008) in postmenopausal women compared with pre-or early perimenopausal women. Additional adjustment for estradiol and hormone therapy attenuated these differences. Moreover, the association between PAT and CAC extent was stronger in women with lower estradiol levels (interaction P=0.004). Conclusions-The findings suggest that PAT is a potential menopause-specific coronary artery disease risk marker, supporting the need to monitor and target this fat depot for intervention in women at midlife.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Three-way decisions; Concept learning; Cognitive operator; Granular computing; Information fusion        	The theory of three-way decisions is to consider a decision-making problem as a ternary classification one which is realized by the acceptance, rejection and non-commitment. Recently, this theory has been integrated with formal concept analysis in two different ways: constructive and axiomatic methods. The constructive method is to define certain three-way concepts in a formal context to support three-way concept analysis, while the axiomatic one is to characterize general three-way concepts by axioms so as to perform three-way concept learning. Nevertheless, there are similarities between the constructive and the axiomatic methods. In fact, both three-way concept analysis induced by the constructive method and three-way concept learning induced by the axiomatic one are realized by incorporating the idea of ternary classification into the design of extent or intent of a concept. However, their information fusion abilities need to be improved since neither of them is able to deal with large or multi-source data effectively. Motivated by this problem, our paper is to reconsider three-way concept learning based on cognitive operators from the perspective of information fusion. That is, the parallel computing techniques of learning three-way concepts are developed for large and multi-source data. Specifically, for large data, the relationship between the global granular concept and the local ones is first clarified, and then it is employed to design an information fusion algorithm. For multi-source data, the whole evaluation function used to induce three-way decisions is established by aggregating the results obtained in each single-source data, and three-way concept learning is made by constructing lower and upper approximation concepts. Finally, we conduct some numerical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed parallel computing algorithms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
5	9	81	Medical 	 Skin Care  	 Acne; Negative; Perception; Quality of life; Scars; Society; Treatment        	Introduction: Atrophic scarring occurs throughout the course of inflammatory acne and across the spectrum of severity. This study evaluates perceptions of the general population toward individuals with clear skin and acne scars. Methods: An online survey administered in the USA, UK, Japan, Germany, France and Brazil to respondents 18 years and over presented three facial pictures of clear skin or digitally superimposed acne scars (but no active acne lesions) in a random fashion. At least one clear and one scar picture were presented to each participant. Results: Among the 4618 responders, 33% themselves had facial acne scars. The skin was the first thing noticed about the face by 41% when viewing pictures with scars vs 8% viewing clear skin (p < 0.05). Those with scars were less likely to be considered attractive (17% vs 25%), confident (25% vs 33%), happy (23% vs 30%), healthy (21% vs 31%) and successful (17% vs 24%), and more likely to be perceived as insecure (15% vs 8%) and shy (23% vs 14%) compared with those with clear skin (all p < 0.05). The significance of the responses obtained varied according to the acne and scar status of the respondent. Skin care was cited as the habit most in need of improvement by 59% vs 13% of respondents viewing pictures with scars vs clear skin, respectively (p < 0.05). All respondent subgroups cited skin care irrespective of their own acne and scar status (all p < 0.05 vs pictures with clear skin). Those with scars were thought less likely to have a promising future (78% vs 84%) than those with clear skin (p < 0.05). The majority of respondents reported willingness to pay money to eradicate scars. Conclusion: The results of this multi-national survey demonstrate that facial acne scars are perceived negatively by society, confirming the importance of preventing acne scars with early treatment of inflammatory acne.

MethodsAdult female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and microdyalysis in the PFC and cystometrography (CMG) were performed under consciousness and free movement in the present study. Experiment 1: Samples including extracellular neurotransmitters were collected by microdyalysis and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. At the same time, CMG were performed to measure intercontraction interval (ICI) and maximum voiding pressure (MVP). Experiment 2: SSRI (citalopram, 1 mu M) was administered into the PFC, and microdyalysis and cystometrography (CMG) were performed simultaneously. Experiment 3: Following SSRI administration, 5-HT1A agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 300 mu M), which has the effect of decreasing the level of serotonin (5-HT) in the PFC, was administered into the PFC, and microdyalysis and CMG were performed simultaneously. ResultsExperiment 1: Extracellular level of 5-HT in the PFC significantly increased during micturition reflex (P<0.05), whereas levels of glutamate or dopamine were not significantly changed. Experiment 2: Local administration of SSRI in the PFC increased the 5-HT level up to approximate 600% of the basal level. It also significantly increased ICI (P<0.05), whereas no significant change was found in MVP. Experiment 3: The extracellular level of 5-HT gradually decreased after local administration of 5-HT1A agonist, thereby ICI significantly decreased (P<0.05). ConclusionsThe results of the present study suggest that the PFC has a suppressive effect on neural control of the micturition reflex via serotonin. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:902-907, 2016.

2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 Alzheimer's disease; Semantic features; Semantic content; Semantic process        	A central topic of discussion in the exploration of semantic disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) concerns the relative contribution of semantic content (e.g., semantic features) and semantic process. Studies have suggested that semantic dysfunction in AD is the result of deficits to either semantic process, semantic content or both. Studies that have supported the loss of semantic content have been criticised for their use of verbal stimuli and cognitively challenging experimental tasks. The current study used a novel version of the yes no recognition memory task to compare the processing of distinctive and non-distinctive features in participants with AD whilst controlling the cognitive demands of the task. The task involved five conditions which denoted the relationship between the items in the test and study phase. A 'non-distinctive' and a 'distinctive' condition were included where non-distinctive and distinctive semantic features were manipulated between study and test, respectively. Task accuracy of participants with AD decreased relative to control participants when distinctive features were manipulated between the study and test phase of the experiment. There was no significant difference between groups when non-distinctive features were manipulated. These findings provide evidence to support the loss of semantic content in AD.

0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Colour detection; colour model; colour purity; colour brightness; multichannel thresholding; histogram back projection        	Colour detection plays an important role for many computer vision-based applications. However, most existing colour detection methods tend to be environment dependent since slight changes of environmental factors such as illumination or shadowing effects could greatly reduce their performances. In this paper, a new colour model is introduced to allow enhanced colour detection from images, even with significantly different lighting conditions and image qualities. The proposed colour model is called the HPBr colour model. It is converted from the RGB colour model and it consists of three colour components, namely, hue (H), purity (P) and brightness (Br). This colour model can be represented in three different geometric shapes: diamond, sphere and cylinder. To assess the effectiveness of the model, two different colour detection methods have been applied onto benchmark images. Experimental results from both methods confirmed that the proposed colour model produced the best colour detection results among existing models.
5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 testosterone; diabetes; glucose metabolism; insulin resistance; obesity        	A wealth of observational studies show that low testosterone is associated with insulin resistance and with an increased risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which low testosterone may lead to insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is an important intermediate in this relationship. Actions of testosterone or its metabolite oestradiol on other tissues such as muscle, liver, bone or the brain, and body composition-independent effects may also play a role. However, definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether the association of low testosterone with disordered glucose metabolism is causative is currently lacking. It therefore remains possible that this association is due to reverse causation, or simply originates by association with common health and lifestyle factors. RCTs of testosterone therapy in men with or without diabetes consistently show modest metabolically favourable changes in body composition. Despite this, testosterone effects on glucose metabolism have been inconsistent. Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression in the majority of obese men with metabolic disorders is functional, and may be, at least in part, reversible with weight loss. Until further evidence is available, lifestyle measures with emphasis on weight reduction, treatment of comorbidities and optimisation of diabetic control should remain the first-line treatment in these men. Such measures, if successful, may be sufficient to normalise testosterone levels in men with metabolic disorders, who typically have only modest reductions in circulating testosterone levels.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 Primary cilia; Ciliary bulb; Ciliary membrane swelling; Fluid-shear stress; Bicc-1; GM3S; PC2        	Dysfunction of many ciliary proteins has been linked to a list of diseases, from cystic kidney to obesity and from hypertension to mental retardation. We previously proposed that primary cilia are unique communication organelles that function as microsensory compartments that house mechanosensory molecules. Here we report that primary cilia exhibit membrane swellings or ciliary bulbs, which based on their unique ultrastructure and motility, could be mechanically regulated by fluid-shear stress. Together with the ultrastructure analysis of the swelling, which contains monosialodihexosylganglioside (GM3), our results show that ciliary bulb has a distinctive set of functional proteins, including GM3 synthase (GM3S), bicaudal-c1 (Bicc1), and polycystin-2 (PC2). In fact, results from our cilia isolation demonstrated for the first time that GM3S and Bicc1 are members of the primary cilia proteins. Although these proteins are not required for ciliary membrane swelling formation under static condition, fluid-shear stress induced swelling formation is partially modulated by GM3S. We therefore propose that the ciliary bulb exhibits a sensory function within the mechano-ciliary structure. Overall, our studies provided an important step towards understanding the ciliary bulb function and structure.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Enzyme mechanism; Radical enzyme; Iron-sulfur cluster; Biotin biosynthesis; Cofactor biosynthesis        	The enzyme cofactor and essential vitamin biotin is biosynthesized in bacteria, fungi, and plants through a pathway that culminates with the addition of a sulfur atom to generate the five-membered thiophane ring. The immediate precursor, dethiobiotin, has methylene and methyl groups at the C6 and C9 positions, respectively, and formation of a thioether bridging these carbon atoms requires cleavage of unactivated C-H bonds. Biotin synthase is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) radical enzyme that catalyzes reduction of the AdoMet sulfonium to produce 5'-deoxyadenosyl radicals, high-energy carbon radicals that can directly abstract hydrogen atoms from dethiobiotin. The available experimental and structural data suggest that a [2Fe-2S](2+) cluster bound deep within biotin synthase provides a sulfur atom that is added to dethiobiotin in a stepwise reaction, first at the C9 position to generate 9-mercaptodethiobiotin, and then at the C6 position to close the thiophane ring. The formation of sulfur-containing biomolecules through a radical reaction involving an iron-sulfur cluster is an unprecedented reaction in biochemistry; however, recent enzyme discoveries suggest that radical sulfur insertion reactions may be a distinct subgroup within the burgeoning Radical SAM superfamily.

5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Bone strength; Fracture; Distal radius; Finite element analysis; HR-pQCT; Osteoporosis; Reproducibility        	Fractures of the distal section of the radius (Colles' fractures) occur earlier in life than other osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, they can be interpreted as a warning signal for later, more deleterious fractures of vertebral bodies or the femoral neck. In the past decade, the advent of HR-pQCT allowed a detailed architectural analysis of the distal radius and an automated but time-consuming estimation of its strength with linear micro-finite element (mu FE) analysis. Recently, a second generation of HR-pQCT scanner (XtremeCT II, SCANCO Medical, Switzerland) with a resolution beyond 61 pm became available for even more refined biomechanical investigations in vivo. This raises the question how biomechanical outcome variables compare between the original (LR) and the new (HR) scanner resolution. Accordingly, the aim of this work was to validate experimentally a patient-specific homogenized finite element (mu FE) analysis of the distal section of the human radius for the fast prediction of Colles' fracture load based on the last generation HR-pQCT. Fourteen pairs of fresh frozen forearms (mean age = 77.5 +/- 9) were scanned intact using the high (61 mu m) and the low (82 mu m) resolution protocols that correspond to the new and original HR-pQCT systems. From each forearm, the 20 mm most distal section of the radius were dissected out, scanned with mu CT at 16.4 m and tested experimentally under compression up to failure for assessment of stiffness and ultimate load. Linear and nonlinear hFE models together with linear micro finite element (mu FE) models were then generated based on the mu CT and HR-pQCT reconstructions to predict the aforementioned mechanical properties of 24 sections. Precision errors of the short term reproducibility of the FE analyses were measured based on the repeated scans of 12 sections. The calculated failure loads correlated strongly with those measured in the experiments: accounting for donor as a random factor, the nonlinear hFE provided a marginal coefficient of determination (R-m(2)) of 0.957 for the high resolution (HR) and 0.948 for the low resolution (LR) protocols, the linear hFE with R-m(2) of 0.957 for the HR and 0.947 for the LR protocols. Linear FE predictions of the ultimate load were similar with an R-m(2) of 0.950 for the HR and 0.954 for the LR protocols, respectively. Nonlinear hFE strength computation led to precision errors of 2.2 and 2.3% which were higher than the ones calculated based on the linear hFE (1.6 and 1.9%) and linear mu FE (1.2 and 1.6%) for the HR and LR protocols respectively. Computation of the fracture load with nonlinear hFE demanded in average 6 h of CPU time which was 3 times faster than with linear mu FE, while computation with linear hFE took only a few minutes. This study delivers an extensive experimental and numerical validation for the application of an accurate and fast hFE diagnostic tool to help in identifying individuals who may be at risk of an osteoporotic wrist fracture and to follow up pharmacological and other treatments in such patients.

5	2	74	Medical 	 Alzheimer's Disease  	 Acetylcholinesterase; PET; MP4A        	In Alzheimer's disease (AD), white matter lesions (WMLs) are associated with an increased risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, while memory deficits have, at least in part, been linked to a cholinergic deficit. We investigated the relationship betweenWMLload assessed with the Scheltens scale, cerebral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity measured with [C-11] N-methyl-4-piperidyl acetate PET, and neuropsychological performance in 17 patients with MCI due to AD and 18 cognitively normal older participants. Only periventricular, not nonperiventricular, WML load negatively correlated with AChE activity in both groups. Memory performance depended on periventricular and total WML load across groups. Crucially, AChE activity predicted memory function better than WML load, gray matter atrophy, or age. The effects ofWMLload on memory were fully mediated byAChE activity. Data suggest that the contribution of WML to the dysfunction of the cholinergic system in MCI due to AD depends on WML distribution. Pharmacologic studies are warranted to explore whether this influences the response to cholinergic treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 DPSc; Osteogenesis; Dental pulp; Dental implant; Titanium        	Surface characteristics play a special role for the biological performance of implants and several strategies are available to this end. The OGI (Osteo Growth Induction) titanium surface is a surface, obtained by applying a strong acid onto the blasted surface. The aim of this in-vitro study is to evaluate in vitro the osteoproperties of OGI surfaces on Mesenchymal Stem cells derived from dental pulp. Our results confirm that this treatment exert a positive effect on mitochondrial homeostasis, as shown by a decrease in ROS production related to environmental stress on the mitochondria. Morphological and molecular biology analyses confirmed more over that the DPSC cultured on the OGI surfaces appeared more spread in comparison to those grown on control titanium surface and real time PCR and biochemical data clearly demonstrated the increase of osteoconductive properties of the OGI treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that mesenchymal stem cells sensitively respond to surface properties related to OGI treatment enhancing their osteogenic activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 Euthyroidism; Free triiodothyronine; Free thyroxine; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Central obesity        	Objective. Overt hypothyroidism confers an increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The liver plays a crucial role in the metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides; thyroid hormones interact on hepatic lipid homeostasis. Thyroid function within the euthyroid range affects a number of health issues, including atherosclerosis development and biochemical markers of increased cardiovascular risk. However, the association of thyroid hormones with NAFLD in euthyroid subjects has not been unequivocally established. We therefore determined associations of thyroid hormone parameters with NAFLD among euthyroid subjects. Methods. The study was conducted in the Lifelines Cohort Study, a population-based cohort study of participants living in the North of the Netherlands. Only euthyroid subjects (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.5-4.0 mU/L, free thyroxine (FT4) 11-19.5 pmol/L and free triiodothyronine (FT3) 4.4-6.7 pmol/L) older than 18 years were included. Exclusion criteria were participants with excessive alcohol use, known hepatitis or cirrhosis, liver functions >three times the upper limit, current cancer, non-white ancestry, previous or current use of thyroid medication and current use of lipid or glucose lowering medication. A priori defined liver biochemistry, thyroid function parameters and metabolic syndrome (MetS) were studied. NAFLD was defined by using the validated Fatty Liver Index (FLI); FLI >60 was categorized as NAFLD. A P= 60 was found in 4274 (21.1%) of 20,289 individuals (62.1% male, median age 46 years) with increased prevalence of MetS (P= 60 was independently associated with a higher FT3 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.29-1.39, per SD increment, P < 0.0001) and a lower FT4 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.70-0.75, P < 0.0001) but not by TSH. The strongest association was found for the FT3/FT4 ratio (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.39-1.49, P < 0.0001). These associations remained similar after additional adjustment for the presence of MetS. In subjects with enlarged waist circumference, TSH and FT4 were lower while FT3 was higher, resulting in an increased FT3/FT4 ratio (P < 0.0001). Conclusions. Euthyroid subjects with suspected NAFLD are characterized by higher FT3, lower FT4 and higher FT3/FT4 ratio, probably consequent to central obesity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

2	0	33	Psychology  	 Prejudice  	 Alcohol; stereotyping; emergency departments; frequent attenders; qualitative research        	Aims: To provide new insights into the socio-demographic characteristics of people who frequently attend Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments for alcohol-related reasons and to explore the findings with reference to stereotyping and prejudice. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 30 individuals (18 males; 12 females; aged 20-68 years) recruited from six A&E departments across London, United Kingdom. Participants had all attended A&E 10 times within the last year or 5 times in the last three months for an alcohol-related condition. Detailed data relating to participants' socio-demographic characteristics were systematically coded and analysed. Findings: Participants reported many years of heavy drinking, and high levels of mental and physical ill health, unemployment, dependence on state benefits, housing problems and social isolation. Frequency of A&E attendances varied greatly by participant, patterns of drinking and other substance use were diverse, and the nature and extent of self-reported health and social problems were wide-ranging. Conclusions: Findings suggest that people who regularly attend A&E for alcohol-related reasons collectively experience multiple and complex needs, but individually have diverse patterns of drinking and other problems. Flexible person-centred systems could help to support this patient population, whilst avoidance of terminology that overstates group traits should help to minimise stigma.
5	5	77	Medical 	 Asthma  	 Atopy; Stress; Alpha-amylase; Aldosterone; Anxiety; Coping strategies        	A decreased responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis to stress stimuli in patients with atopy is well documented. The aim of this study was to investigate personality traits, salivary alpha amylase activity and the aldosterone response to psychosocial stress procedure based on public speech in atopic patients with respect to sex and the menstrual cycle (MC) phase. The study was performed in 106 subjects of both sexes, 53 atopic patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma or atopic dermatitis and 53 age-, sex-, the MC phase- and BMI- matched healthy controls. Substantially attenuated activity of alpha-amylase and reduced secretion of aldosterone during the psychosocial stress were observed in the whole sample of patients with atopy. Higher activity of alpha-amylase observed in the follicular compared to the luteal phase in healthy women was not present in atopic patients. In both males and females, atopy was associated with blunted cortisol response but no changes in the heart rate. Psychological characterization revealed a significantly higher trait anxiety and higher preference for avoidance-oriented coping strategy in female but not male atopic patients. These findings provide evidence that patients with atopy exhibit insufficient alpha-amylase and aldosterone responsiveness to psychosocial stress, thus suggesting decreased sympathetic activity. Potential disturbances in sex hormone status during the MC in female patients with atopy have to be considered in future research. Changes in personality traits were demonstrated in female atopic patients, but not in male patients. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Residents; Psychotherapy; Residents; Supervision        	Objective Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment with efficacy in reducing self-harm behaviors in borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study describes and evaluates a clinical curriculum to teach DBT to psychiatry residents, developed at a large urban university hospital. The curriculum objectives are to (1) have psychiatry residents achieve basic understanding of DBT theory and clinical skill, (2) increase residents' ability and confidence in treating self-harm behaviors (both suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury), and (3) enhance residents' willingness to treat individuals with BPD. Methods In addition to a 6-week didactic course on DBT offered to all residents (n = 62), 25 elected to enroll in a year-long DBT clinical training curriculum over the course of a 5-year period. The DBT clinical training consisted of 15 h of additional didactics, ongoing conduct of individual therapy and group DBT skills training, videotaping of individual therapy sessions, and weekly supervision meetings utilizing videotape to provide feedback. Residents participating in the clinical training program videotaped baseline and later sessions, which were rated for DBT adherence. All 62 graduates of the program were surveyed regarding the impact of the training on their practice of psychiatry. Results Upon graduation, a high percentage (87 % in the curriculum and 70 % in the didactic course only) reported incorporating DBT into their psychiatry practice, as well as willingness and confidence in treating BPD and self-harm behaviors. Residents participating in the clinical training demonstrated significant improvement in their ability to utilize DBT interventions, particularly in structuring sessions, problem assessment, problem solving, and using validation and dialectical strategies. Conclusion This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training. Limitations include a small sample size and lack of baseline survey measurement of attitudes for pre- and post-curriculum comparison.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Aerial robotics; Sensor fusion; Ego-motion estimation; Optic-flow        	We aim at developing autonomous miniature hovering flying robots capable of navigating in unstructured GPS-denied environments. A major challenge is the miniaturization of the embedded sensors and processors that allow such platforms to fly by themselves. In this paper, we propose a novel ego-motion estimation algorithm for hovering robots equipped with inertial and optic-flow sensors that runs in real-time on a microcontroller and enables autonomous flight. Unlike many vision-based methods, this algorithm does not rely on feature tracking, structure estimation, additional distance sensors or assumptions about the environment. In this method, we introduce the translational optic-flow direction constraint, which uses the optic-flow direction but not its scale to correct for inertial sensor drift during changes of direction. This solution requires comparatively much simpler electronics and sensors and works in environments of any geometry. Here we describe the implementation and performance of the method on a hovering robot equipped with eight 0.65 g optic-flow sensors, and show that it can be used for closed-loop control of various motions.
2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 consciousness; decision making; EEG; metacognition        	"Successful decision making critically involves metacognitive processes such as monitoring and control of our decision process. Metacognition enables agents to modify ongoing behavior adaptively and determine what to do next in situations in which external feedback is not (immediately) available. Despite the importance of metacognition for many aspects of life, little is known about how our metacognitive system operates or about what kind of information is used for metacognitive (second-order) judgments. In particular, it remains an open question whether metacognitive judgments are based on the same information as first-order decisions. Here, we investigated the relationship between metacognitive performance and first-order task performance by recording EEG signals while participants were asked to make a ""diagnosis"" after seeing a sample of fictitious patient data (a complex pattern of colored moving dots of different sizes). To assess metacognitive performance, participants provided an estimate about the quality of their diagnosis on each trial. Results demonstrate that the information that contributes to first-order decisions differs from the information that supports metacognitive judgments. Further, time-frequency analyses of EEG signals reveal that metacognitive performance is associated specifically with prefrontal theta-band activity. Together, our findings are consistent with a hierarchical model of metacognition and suggest a crucial role for prefrontal oscillations in metacognitive performance."

It is established that the ion exchange of tryptophan against the background of the exchange of mineral ions (OH--Cl-) is better accomplished from alkaline solutions on the Cl- form of the adsorbent and the overequivalent adsorption of an amino acid from a salt-containing solution on the OH- form of the anion exchange resin. The results from calculating and analyzing the thermodynamic constants of ion exchange and non-exchange absorption are given.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 antisocial personality disorder; Psychopathy; sex; race; violence        	The present study used data on prisoners to advance our understanding of the joint effects of sex, race, and psychopathology, specifically antisocial personality disorder (APD) and Psychopathy, on criminal violence. The sample comprised 3,525 male and 1,579 female inmates between the ages of 18 and 45 years who were incarcerated in state prisons in Wisconsin at the time of data collection. Multivariate analyses were used to examine all sex-race-psychopathology combinations. The findings indicate that Black males and females with comorbid APD and Psychopathy were more likely to commit violent crime than similarly situated White males. While gendered patterns of aggression may characterize males and females in the aggregate, the present study clearly highlights the importance of considering sex/race subgroups when examining the relationship between psychopathology and violent crime.
2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 education; field of practice; adults; population        	The aim of this article is to address some of the questions Dr. Paula S. Nurius presents in her article, Innovation and Emerging Scientific Careers: Is Social Work Prepared to Compete in Todays Scientific Marketplace? Specifically, this article will focus on what we can do to better prepare our emerging research scholars to be successful innovators through trans-disciplinary training and educational activities. This article recommends two main ideas. The first main idea is that social work co-host meetings, lectures, roundtables and trainings with disciplines we do not tend to collaborate with, in order to build inter-disciplinary partnerships. The second suggestion is that students are socially integrated, via extensive interaction of outside disciplines, through customized semester-long rotation style trainings. By implementing these suggestions, we will be providing a space for our doctoral students to gain an understanding of how different disciplines researchers, technologies, and/or methods can add to their ability to produce innovative ideas, encouraging creative and complex thinking and problem solving.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Breast neoplasms; Musculoskeletal manipulations; Neck; Pain; Rehabilitation; Shoulder        	Objectives: To (1) investigate the immediate effects of myofascial induction (MI), with placebo electrotherapy as a control, on perceived pain, cervical/shoulder range of motion (ROM), and mood state in breast cancer survivors (BCSs) with shoulder/arm morbidity; and (2) examine the relationships between pain modifications and cervical/shoulder ROM on the side affected by breast cancer. Design: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Setting: Physical therapy laboratory. Participants: BCSs (N=21) who had a diagnosis of stage I-IIIA breast cancer and had completed adjuvant therapy (except hormonal treatment). Intervention: During each session, the BCSs received either an MI (fascial unwinding) intervention focused on the upper limb area following the Pilat approach or placebo pulsed shortwave therapy (control group). Each session lasted 30 minutes, and an adequate washout period of 4 weeks between sessions was established. Main Outcome Measures: The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and anxiety, shoulder-cervical goniometry for ROM, the Profile of Mood States for psychological distress, and the Attitudes Towards Massage Scale were used. Results: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed significant time x group interactions for VAS affected arm (P=.031) but not for VAS cervical (P=.332), VAS nonaffected arm (P=.698), or VAS anxiety (P=.266). The ANCOVA also revealed significant interactions for affected shoulder flexion (P<.001), abduction (P<.001), external rotation (P=.004), and internal rotation (P=.001). Significant interactions for affected cervical rotation (P=.022) and affected cervical lateral flexion (P=.038) were also found. A significant negative correlation was found between changes in VAS affected arm and shoulder/arm internal rotation ROM (r=.46; P=.03). Conclusions: A single MI session decreases pain intensity and improves neck-shoulder ROM to a greater degree than placebo electrotherapy for BCSs experiencing pain.

5	26	98	Medical 	 HIV/AIDS  	 Novel virus; Virome; Viral metagenomics; VirusSeeker; Pathogen discovery        	The advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has vastly increased our ability to discover novel viruses and to systematically define the spectrum of viruses present in a given specimen. Such studies have led to the discovery of novel viral pathogens as well as broader associations of the virome with diverse diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, severe acute malnutrition and HIV/AIDS. Critical to the success of these efforts are robust bioinformatic pipelines for rapid classification of microbial sequences. Existing computational tools are typically focused on either eukaryotic virus discovery or virome composition analysis but not both. Here we present VirusSeeker, a BLAST-based NGS data analysis pipeline designed for both purposes. VirusSeeker has been successfully applied in several previously published virome studies. Here we demonstrate the functionality of VirusSeeker in both novel virus discovery and virome composition analysis.
0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 Memory diagnostic; DRAM; Chip multiprocessors        	Memory diagnostics are important to improving the resilience of DRAM main memory. As bit cell size reaches physical limits, DRAM memory will be more likely to suffer both transient and permanent errors. Memory diagnostics that operate online can be a component of a comprehensive strategy to allay errors. This paper presents a novel approach, Asteroid, to integrate online memory diagnostics during workload execution. The approach supports diagnostics that adapt at runtime to workload behavior and resource availability to maximize test quality while reducing performance overhead. We describe Asteroid's design and how it can be efficiently integrated with a hierarchical memory allocator in modern operating systems. We also present how the framework enables control policies to dynamically configure a diagnostic. Using an adaptive policy, in a 16-core server, Asteroid has modest overhead of 1-4 % for workloads with low to high memory demand. For these workloads, Asteroid's adaptive policy has good error coverage and can thoroughly test memory.

1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Current control; dc power systems; dc-dc power conversion; digital control; energy management; fuel cells (FCs); power conditioning; power system control        	In this paper, a serial-parallel hybrid (SPH) power system formed by a fuel cell (FC), an auxiliary storage device (ASD), and the current-controlled dc-dc converters responsible for the power management are realized by using the digital signal controller (DSC) TMS32F28335. The main energy management goal is to transfer energy from the sources (FC or ASD) to the load while ensuring dc bus voltage regulation and high power conversion efficiency. In addition, a safe and reliable operation of the system has to be achieved. The selected converter and its controller features are noninverting voltage step up and step down, high efficiency, regulation of input and output currents and low ripple values, and the ability to change from input to output current regulation loop, suddenly and smoothly, and vice versa. All these features allow it to be positioned in different FC system localizations and simplify the design of the master control. Simulation and experimental results have been validated on a 48-V 1200-W dc bus.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Bayesian network (BN); clique-tree; embedded machine learning; hardware accelerator; intelligent sensor node; message passing; probabilistic graphical model; probabilistic inference        	A hardware accelerator is presented to compute the probabilistic inference for a Bayesian network (BN) in distributed sensing applications. For energy efficiency, the accelerator is operated at a near-threshold voltage of 0.5 V, while achieving a maximum clock frequency of 33 MHz. Clique-tree message passing algorithm is leveraged to compute the probabilistic inference. The theoretical maximum size of a factor that the proposed hardware accelerator can handle is 2((8x20)=160) entries, which is sufficient for handling massive BNs, such as PATHFINDER, MUNIN, and so on (>1000 nodes). A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism (ALARM) BN is used to benchmark the performance of the accelerator. The accelerator consumes 76 nJ to execute the ALARM network using a clique-tree message-passing algorithm, while the same algorithm executed on an ultralow-power microcontroller consumes 20 mJ.
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 adolescent; anorexia nervosa; definition; Delphi; exercise; treatment        	This study aimed to explore and synthesize expert clinical knowledge on defining and managing unhealthy exercise in adolescents with AN. The Delphi methodology was used. Clinicians (n=25) considered experts in the treatment of AN in adolescents were recruited internationally to form the panel. The first round of the questionnaires was comprised of five open-ended questions regarding defining, assessing, and treating unhealthy exercise in adolescents with AN. Statements were derived from this data using content analysis, and included as Likert-based items in two subsequent rounds, in which panellists were required to rate their level of agreement for each item. All 25 respondents completed the three rounds of questionnaires. Consensus was achieved for 59.0% of the items included in the second and third round of questionnaires. Although consensus was not achieved, compulsive exercise was the preferred term for the panel when referring to unhealthy exercise in adolescents with AN. The panel clearly delineated features of unhealthy and healthy exercise, and endorsed a number of items considered important to assess for when evaluating exercise in this clinical population. A variety of treatment approaches and strategies reached consensus. Notably, for those who are medically stable and progressing toward recovery, the panel recommended initial exercise restriction practices and reintroducing healthy exercise behaviors, rather than exercise cessation practices. The current findings can serve as preliminary treatment guidelines. A unified approach to labeling and defining unhealthy exercise in the eating disorder literature and clinical settings is required to achieve further progress.
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 music and dance; synchronization; entrainment; eye movements; person perception        	"In previous studies investigating entrainment and person perception, synchronized movements were found to enhance memory for incidental person attributes. Although this effect is robust, including in dance, the process by which it is actuated are less well understood. In this study, two hypotheses are investigated: that enhanced memory for person attributes is the result of (1) increased gaze time between in-tempo dancers; and/or (2) greater attentional focus between in tempo dancers. To explore these possible mechanisms in the context of observing dance, an eye-tracking study was conducted in which subjects watched videos of pairs of laterally positioned dancers; only one of the dancers was synchronized with the music, the other being asynchronous. The results were consistent with the first hypothesis-music-dance synchrony gives rise to increased visual inspection times. In addition, there was a preference for upper-body fixations over lower-body fixations across both synchronous and asynchronous conditions. A subsequent, single-dancer eye-tracking study investigated fixations across different body regions, including head, torso, legs and feet. Significantly greater dwell times were recorded for head than torso and legs; feet attracted significantly less dwell time than any other body region. Lastly, the study sought to identify dance gestures responsible for torso- and head-directed fixations. Specifically we asked whether there are features in dance that are specially designed to direct an observer's gaze towards the face- the main ""communicative portal"" with respect to the transmission of intent, affect and empathy."
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Battery-assisted passive (BAP); CMOS; power management; radio-frequency identification (RFID); sensor tag; ultrahigh frequency (UHF)        	Herein, we present a fully integrated electronic product code (EPC) Gen-2 compatible battery-assisted passive (BAP) radio-frequency identification sensor tag integrated circuit (IC) with efficient power management. The key components of the tag IC include an adaptive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvester, a battery access controller (BAC), a storage capacitor charger, and a power-gated sensor block. External RF energy is efficiently harvested using dynamically controlled rectifying stages and a threshold-compensation technique. The BAC tightly controls the power path, cutting off leakage current from the battery. The power-gated sensor block supports multiplexed sensing operations in a power efficient manner. The sensor interface includes a chopper amplifier, a programmable gain amplifier, multiplexers, and an 8-bit ADC. For sensing data logging, custom designed nonvolatile memory is employed via one-time programmable memory. The digital control block is based on an EPCglobal Gen-2 standard that is modified to support the sensing operation. The tag chip was fabricated in a 1-poly 6-metal standard 0.18-mu m standard CMOS process. The tag IC consumes 1 mu A for leakage and active operation (0.1% duty), and the estimated lifespan of the BAP tag IC is about 0.2 year/mA.h.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 Process mining; Activity prediction; Process prediction        	In addition to the classical exploitation as a means for checking process enactment conformance, process models may be precious for making various kinds of predictions about the process enactment itself (e.g., which activities will be carried out next, or which of a set of candidate processes is actually being executed). These predictions may be much more important, but much more hard to be obtained as well, in less common applications of process mining, such as those related to Ambient Intelligence. Also, the prediction performance may provide indirect indications on the correctness and reliability of a process model. This paper proposes a way to make these kinds of predictions using the WoMan framework for workflow management, that has proved to be able to handle complex processes. Experimental results on different domains suggest that the prediction ability of WoMan is noteworthy and may be useful to support the users in carrying out their processes.
2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 inference; false memory; episodic memory; memory; associative processes        	Episodic memory involves flexible retrieval processes that allow us to link together distinct episodes, make novel inferences across overlapping events, and recombine elements of past experiences when imagining future events. However, the same flexible retrieval and recombination processes that underpin these adaptive functions may also leave memory prone to error or distortion, such as source misattributions in which details of one event are mistakenly attributed to another related event. To determine whether the same recombination-related retrieval mechanism supports both successful inference and source memory errors, we developed a modified version of an associative inference paradigm in which participants encoded everyday scenes comprised of people, objects, and other contextual details. These scenes contained overlapping elements (AB, BC) that could later be linked to support novel inferential retrieval regarding elements that had not appeared together previously (AC). Our critical experimental manipulation concerned whether contextual details were probed before or after the associative inference test, thereby allowing us to assess whether (a) false memories increased for successful versus unsuccessful inferences, and (b) any such effects were specific to after compared with before participants received the inference test. In each of 4 experiments that used variants of this paradigm, participants were more susceptible to false memories for contextual details after successful than unsuccessful inferential retrieval, but only when contextual details were probed after the associative inference test. These results suggest that the retrieval-mediated recombination mechanism that underlies associative inference also contributes to source misattributions that result from combining elements of distinct episodes.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Circulating tumor cells; Microcavity array; One shot imaging; Wide-field imaging; Fluorescence; CMOS sensor        	Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide potentially accessible in vivo sources of metastatic cancer cells. As such, considerable focus has been placed on analyzing the genetics of single-CTCs. Prior to these analyses, however, CTCs must first be detected within the blood samples of cancer patients. Current methods for detection of CTCs by fluorescence microscopy require the analysis of hundreds of images per blood sample, making this a time-consuming process that creates a bottleneck in CTC analysis. In this study, we therefore developed a wide-field fluorescence imaging system for rapid CTC detection. For these analyses, CTCs were first isolated using the microcavity array (MCA), a micro-sized filter for CTC recovery that separates cells based on differences in cell size and deformability. Notably, the proposed imaging system enabled rapid (similar to 10 s) visualization of all stained cells within the 6 mm x 6 mm MCA field via one-shot imaging. Furthermore, the morphology of the cells in the resulting images accurately reflected that observed by conventional microscopy. In total, isolation and detection of CTCs using the MCA combined with our novel wide-field fluorescence imaging system was achieved within 1 h. Thus, our proposed system will provide rapid CTC detection system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
2	17	50	Psychology  	 Attention  	 Singular value decomposition; Periodic modulation intensity; Signal denoising; Weak feature enhancement; Reweighted singular value decomposition        	Singular value decomposition (SVD), as an effective signal denoising tool, has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. The basic idea behind SVD denoising is to preserve the singular components (SCs) with significant singular values. However, it is shown that the singular values mainly reflect the energy of decomposed SCs, therefore traditional SVD denoising approaches are essentially energy-based, which tend to highlight the high-energy regular components in the measured signal, while ignoring the weak feature caused by early fault. To overcome this issue, a reweighted singular value decomposition (RSVD) strategy is proposed for signal denoising and weak feature enhancement. In this work, a novel information index called periodic modulation intensity is introduced to quantify the diagnostic information in a mechanical signal. With this index, the decomposed SCs can be evaluated and sorted according to their information levels, rather than energy. Based on that, a truncated linear weighting function is proposed to control the contribution of each SC in the reconstruction of the denoised signal, In this way, some weak but informative SCs could be highlighted effectively. The advantages of RSVD over traditional approaches are demonstrated by both simulated signals and real vibration acoustic data from a two-stage gearbox as well as train bearings. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully extract the weak fault feature even in the presence of heavy noise and ambient interferences. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 economic well-being; Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study; health; income; parents with intellectual impairments        	BackgroundWhile the United States has seen increased attention by policymakers on the rights of parents with disabilities, there is limited understanding of the health and economic well-being of parents with intellectual impairments. This study compares the health and economic well-being of mothers with and without intellectual impairments. MethodsThis descriptive, exploratory study is a secondary analysis of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. This study includes a subsample of mothers of three-year-old children (n=1561), including mothers with intellectual impairments (n=263) and without intellectual impairments (n=1298). ResultsUS Mothers with intellectual impairments are more likely to report serious health conditions, have less instrumental support, live in poverty, receive public benefits and experience certain material hardships. ConclusionFindings from this study indicate the need for policies and programmes to support parents with intellectual impairments by addressing their health and economic needs.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Multiple sequence alignment; Core blocks; Alignment accuracy; Accuracy estimation; Parameter advising; Machine learning; Regression        	Background: In a computed protein multiple sequence alignment, the coreness of a column is the fraction of its substitutions that are in so-called core columns of the gold-standard reference alignment of its proteins. In benchmark suites of protein reference alignments, the core columns of the reference alignment are those that can be confidently labeled as correct, usually due to all residues in the column being sufficiently close in the spatial superposition of the known three-dimensional structures of the proteins. Typically the accuracy of a protein multiple sequence alignment that has been computed for a benchmark is only measured with respect to the core columns of the reference alignment. When computing an alignment in practice, however, a reference alignment is not known, so the coreness of its columns can only be predicted. Results: We develop for the first time a predictor of column coreness for protein multiple sequence alignments. This allows us to predict which columns of a computed alignment are core, and hence better estimate the alignment's accuracy. Our approach to predicting coreness is similar to nearest-neighbor classification from machine learning, except we transform nearest-neighbor distances into a coreness prediction via a regression function, and we learn an appropriate distance function through a new optimization formulation that solves a large-scale linear programming problem. We apply our coreness predictor to parameter advising, the task of choosing parameter values for an aligner's scoring function to obtain a more accurate alignment of a specific set of sequences. We show that for this task, our predictor strongly outperforms other column-confidence estimators from the literature, and affords a substantial boost in alignment accuracy.
0	3	3	CS 	 Cryptography  	 quantum cryptanalysis; Simon's algorithm; Feistel network; CBC-MAC        	We present new connections between quantum information and the field of classical cryptography. In particular, we provide examples where Simon's algorithm can be used to show insecurity of commonly used cryptographic symmetric-key primitives. Specifically, these examples consist of a quantum distinguisher for the 3-round Feistel network and a forgery attack on CBC-MAC which forges a tag for a chosen-prefix message querying only other messages (of the same length). We assume that an adversary has quantum-oracle access to the respective classical primitives. Similar results have been achieved recently in independent work by Kaplan et al. [KLLNP16]. Our findings shed new light on the post-quantum security of cryptographic schemes and underline that classical security proofs of cryptographic constructions need to be revisited in light of quantum attackers.

This is a prerequisite for studying the physiology of the isolated organ and for many innovative applications that may be possible in the future, including perfusion decellularization for kidney bioengineering or the administration of anti-rejection or genome-editing drugs in high doses to prime the kidney for transplantation. During the time of the perfusion, the kidney can be manipulated, renal function can be assessed, and various pharmaceuticals administered. After the procedure, the kidney can be transplanted or processed for molecular biology, biochemical analysis, or microscopy. This paper describes the perfusate and the surgical technique needed for the ex vivo perfusion of mouse kidneys. Details of the perfusion apparatus are given and data are presented showing the viability of the kidney's preparation: renal blood flow, vascular resistance, and urine data as functional, transmission electron micrographs of different nephron segments as morphological readouts, and western blots of transport proteins of different nephron segments as molecular readout.

We compared the potential in vitro metabolism of human, porcine and rat hepatocytes over 2 weeks in culture in an organotypical culture model which reflects the in vivo situation. All three species show similar LDH-rates. Albumin measurements showed that rat cells are about twice as active as human and porcine hepatocytes. The ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity of the rat hepatocytes is with about 14 mu U/10(6) cells distinctly higher than those of porcine and human cells (1.8 and 0.5 mu U/10(6)cells respectively), furthermore, the activity of the rat EROD increases slightly during the prolonged time in culture, whereas those of porcine and human enzymes slightly decrease. Concerning ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase (ECOD), the enzyme activities are found to be in three different ranges where rat cells show the highest activity with 66 mu U/10(6) cells, porcine hepatocytes exhibit an activity of about 23 mu U/10(6) cells, and human activity is lowest with 0.7 mu U/10(6)cells. All three species show a similar decreasing trend of ECOD during the period of study. Regarding the biotransformation of testosterome, human and porcine liver cells form three major metabolites whereas rat cells form a mixture of all measured metabolites. Hence, in vitro metabolism using porcine hepatocytes would be much more scientific sense than one using rat hepatocytes since the metabolic pathways are much closer to human metabolism.

In this control scheme, the gains of the PID controller are updated by using an adaptive mechanism, fuzzy rules, the gradient search method, and the chain rule of differentiation in order to minimize the sliding surfaces of sliding mode control. More precisely, sliding mode control is used as a supervisory controller to provide sufficient control inputs and guarantee the stability of the control approach. To ascertain the parameters of the proposed controller and avoid trial and error, the multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to augment the performance of proposed controller. The chaotic system of a Duffing-Holmes oscillator andan industrial robotic manipulator are the case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed control approach. The obtained results of this study regarding both systems are compared with the outcomes of two notable studies in the literature. The results and analysis prove the efficiency of the proposed controller with regard to MIMO uncertain systems having challenging external disturbances in terms of stability, minimum tracking error and optimal control inputs.

This paper deals with the special case of STS cranes characterized by high power peaks and a low load factor that require an over-sized electrical network and cause high costs because electrical utilities charge greatly the power peaks. For these reasons, this paper discusses a comprehensive peak shaving solution that implements the coordination of cranes' duty cycles with a power optimization tool and, as energy storage systems, both ultracapacitors and flywheels, allowing the port operator to optimize their power demand, as well as their network design. The suggested ""hybrid"" solution combines, on the board of each crane, an adequate number of ultracapacitors and in the shore transformer substation, flywheel's modules operating on the simultaneous behavior of the cranes group."
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 asthenozoospermia; gap; PCR; motility; mtDNA; sperm        	Asthenozoospermia is an important cause of male infertility. The mutations in sperm mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) result in either functionless or malfunctioning some proteins, subsequently affecting sperm motility leading to asthenozoospermia. The purpose of this study was to investigate sperm mtDNA 4,977-bp deletion in infertile men with low sperm motility/immotile spermatozoa compared to healthy subjects with high sperm motility. Semen samples of 256 asthenozoospermic infertiles and 200 controls from northern Iran were collected. After extraction of spermatozoa total DNA, Gap-polymerase chain reaction (Gap-PCR) was performed. The deletion was observed in 85.93% of patients with asthenozoospermia compared with 14% in controls [OR=37.5397, 95% confidence interval=12.937-108.9276, p<.0001]. It is concluded that there is a strong association between sperm mtDNA 4,977-bp deletion and asthenozoospermia-induced infertility in the population examined. Large-scale mtDNA deletions in spermatozoa may induce bioenergetic disorders. Nevertheless, to validate our results broader research may be needed.
5	47	119	Medical 	 Rheumatoid Arthritis  	 Rheumatoid arthritis; Cardiovascular disease; Risk assessment; Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia; Smoking cessation        	The increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well known; however, appropriate management of this elevated risk in rheumatology clinics is less clear. Purpose of Review By critically reviewing literature published within the past 5 years, we aim to clarify current knowledge and gaps regarding CVD risk management in RA. Recent Findings We examine recent guidelines, recommendations, and evidence and discuss three approaches: (1) RA-specificmanagement including treat-to-target andmedication management, (2) assessment of comprehensive individual risk, and (3) targeting traditional CVD risk factors (hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity) at a population level. Considering that 75% of US RA visits occur in specialty clinics, further research is needed regarding evidence-based strategies to manage and reduce CVD risk in RA. Summary This review highlights clinical updates including US cardiology and international professional society guidelines, successful evidence-based population approaches from primary care, and novel opportunities in rheumatology care to reduce CVD risk in RA.

Different authors can use several methodologies to learn about research related to their own research in different fields. The main objective of this review is to identify work, research and publications made in the field of the mobile monitoring of patients through some application or commercial or non-commercial solutions in m-Health. Next, we compare the different solutions with our solution, MoMo (Mobile Monitoring) Framework. MoMo is a solution that allows for patient mobile monitoring through mobile phones and biometric devices (blood pressure meter, glucometer and others). Our systematic review is based on the methodology of B. Kitchenham. She proposed specific guidelines for carrying out a systematic review in software engineering. We prepare our systematic review base in the selection of primary and secondary research related to mobile monitoring solutions following criteria with a specific weight to compare with each part of our research.
6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 mercapturic acids; alkylbenzenes; biological monitoring; HPLC/MS/MS; human urine        	It was the aim of this study to ascertain whether xylenes form phenylmercapturic acids via aromatic epoxides in the human metabolism. Aromatic epoxides are suspected to exert mutagenic properties. Therefore we developed an LC/MS/MS procedure for the determination of these mercapturic acids. Using this method we were able to detect dimethylphenylmercapturic acid (DPMA) in urine samples of persons occupationally exposed to xylenes. The unequivocal LC/MS/MS detection of phenylmercapturic acid metabolites of xylene thanks to authentic standards was verified with an independent GC/MS method. Xylene concentrations in the air of the workplaces ranged between 0.7 and 58.1 ppm (median 12.6 ppm). The excretion of methylhippuric acid in the urine samples of the workers (n = 27) ranges from 19.8 to 2332.5 mg/l (median 450.9 mg/l). DPMA was detected in only 9 samples of 27 exposed persons. According to a rough calculation DPMA is only formed in a ratio of 0.0003% respective to the xylene main metabolite MHA. That means that even under occupationally relevant xylene exposure potential mutagenic potencies should be negligible. DPMA in urine is not sensitive enough for general biomonitoring purposes due to the low ratio of excretion. MHA should therefore be used for biomonitoring from now on. Furthermore, our results show that irrespective of the structure of xylene isomers there is no preferences in metabolism.
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 Generation schedule; Emission; Renewable integration; Social welfare; Multi-objective        	Some areas in China are facing pressing air pollution problems. Measures from the power sector can be taken to cope with air pollution issues, including reducing emission levels of thermal units and integrating wind and solar power. Social welfare, emission, and renewable integration are three major concerns in modern power system operations. This paper describes three stochastic scheduling models aiming at maximizing social welfare (SW), minimizing emission (EM) and maximizing renewable production (RE). A multi-objective scheduling model (MT) is also proposed that properly balances the above objectives. Wind power uncertainty and dispatchable loads are considered in the model. The outcomes of the three models are compared through an illustrative example and a 57-node case study. Results show that model EM results in 36% of the social welfare of model SW, 27% of its emissions, and 43% of its wind spillage, while model RE results in 55% of the social welfare of model SW, 56% of its emissions and 28% of its wind spillage. Additionally, we analyze how the optimal generation scheduling is affected by the weights in model MT. This work provides insight to policy makers on how to balance social welfare, emissions and renewable production. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 gram-negative; antimicrobial resistance; observational studies; interventional studies; clinical trials        	Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is one of the most pressing challenges in the field of infectious diseases and is one of 4 key areas of unmet medical need identified by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). The mission of the Gram-Negative Committee is to advance our knowledge of these challenging infections and implement studies to improve patient outcomes. Studies have fallen primarily into 2 broad categories: prospective cohort studies and interventional trials. Among the observational studies, CRACKLE (Consortium on Resistance Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Other Enterobacteriaceae) has contributed seminal multicenter data describing risk factors and clinical outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in sentinel US hospitals. Building on this success, CRACKLE II will expand the network to hospitals across the United States and Colombia. Similar protocols have been proposed to include Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SNAP and POP studies). In addition, the CREST study (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Solid Organ Transplant Patients) has provided pivotal data on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE carriage among solid organ transplant recipients to inform management of this vulnerable patient population. Two clinical trials to define novel ways of using an existing antibiotic, fosfomycin, to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (one that has completed enrollment and the other in late protocol development) will determine the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin as step-down oral therapy to treat complicated urinary tract infections. Additional clinical studies and trials using immunotherapeutic or newly approved agents are also in the planning stage, with the main goals of generating actionable data that will inform clinical decision making and facilitate development of new treatment options for highly resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 capacitor bank; microcontroller; self-excited induction generator (SEIG); stand-alone; three-phase voltage regulator (TPVR)        	This article describes an accurate steady-state analysis of a stand-alone 3-phase self-excited induction generator (SEIG). This analysis, based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm, has shown that the system performance is greatly affected by the parameters related to the availability of primary energy, load variations, and excitation capacitor values. These parameters explain the stator voltage fluctuations and the output frequency decrease. To avoid any interruption of the excitation process and to ensure a good quality of the stand-alone minigrid, a three-phase voltage regulator (TPVR), based on switched capacitors, is proposed to keep the terminal SEIG voltage constant. The control algorithm and the regulation process are implemented using a microcontroller. The SEIG-TPVR is experimentally developed, and a variable capacitor bank is constructed. The experimental investigations on a 1.5-kW induction machine confirm the efficiency of the whole suggested system.
4	2	63	Civil 	 Remote Sensing  	 precipitation; satellite; climatology; ETCCDI; rain gauge; global        	Precipitation is still one of the most complex climate variables to observe, to understand, and to handle within climate monitoring and climate analysis as well as to simulate in numerical weather prediction and climate models. Especially over ocean, less is known about precipitation than over land due to the sparsity of in situ observations. Here, we introduce and discuss a global Expert Team on Climate Change and Indices (ETCCDI)-based precipitation climatology. The basis for computation of this climatology is the global precipitation dataset Daily Precipitation Analysis for Climate Prediction (DAPACLIP) which combines in situ observation data over land and satellite-based remote sensing data over ocean in daily temporal resolution, namely data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and the Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data (HOAPS) dataset. The DAPACLIP dataset spans the period 1988-2008 and thus the global ETCCDI-based precipitation climatology covers 21 years in total. Regional aspects of the climatology are also discussed with focus on Europe and the monsoon region of south-east Asia. To our knowledge, this is the first presentation and discussion of an ETCCDI-based precipitation climatology on a global scale.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Genomics; Immunoproteomics; Multiple sclerosis; Next generation sequencing; Peptide microarrays; PLP1; Precision; Proteomics        	In order to gain mechanistic insights into multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, we utilized a multi-dimensional approach to test the hypothesis that mutations in myelin proteins lead to immune activation and central nervous system autoimmunity in MS. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of human MS brain lesions revealed seven unique mutations of PLP1; a key myelin protein that is known to be destroyed in MS. Surprisingly, in-depth genomic analysis of two MS patients at the genomic DNA and mRNA confirmed mutated PLP1 in RNA, but not in the genomic DNA. Quantification of wild type and mutant PLP RNA levels by qPCR further validated the presence of mutant PLP RNA in the MS patients. To seek evidence linking mutations in abundant myelin proteins and immune-mediated destruction of myelin, specific immune response against mutant PLP1 in MS patients was examined. Thus, we have designed paired, wild type and mutant peptide microarrays, and examined antibody response to multiple mutated PLP1 in sera from MS patients. Consistent with the idea of different patients exhibiting unique mutation profiles, we found that 13 out of 20 MS patients showed antibody responses against specific but not against all the mutant-PLP1 peptides. Interestingly, we found mutant PLP-directed antibody response against specific mutant peptides in the sera of pre-MS controls. The results from integrative proteomic, genomic, and immune analyses reveal a possible mechanism of mutation-driven pathogenesis in human MS. The study also highlights the need for integrative genomic and proteomic analyses for uncovering pathogenic mechanisms of human diseases.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Music therapy; children; adolescents; communication skills; mental health        	BackgroundAlthough music therapy (MT) is considered an effective intervention for young people with mental health needs, its efficacy in clinical settings is unclear. We therefore examined the efficacy of MT in clinical practice. MethodsTwo hundred and fifty-one child (8-16years, with social, emotional, behavioural and developmental difficulties) and parent dyads from six Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service community care facilities in Northern Ireland were randomised to 12 weekly sessions of MT plus usual care [n=123; 76 in final analyses] or usual care alone [n=128; 105 in final analyses]. Follow-up occurred at 13weeks and 26weeks postrandomisation. Primary outcome was improvement in communication (Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales) (SSIS) at 13weeks. Secondary outcomes included social functioning, self-esteem, depression and family functioning. ResultsThere was no significant difference for the child SSIS at week 13 (adjusted difference in mean 2.4; 95% CI -1.2 to 6.1; p=.19) or for the guardian SSIS (0.5; 95% CI -2.9 to 3.8; p=.78). However, for participants aged 13 and over in the intervention group, the child SSIS communication was significantly improved (6.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 10.5; p=.007) but not the guardian SSIS (1.1; 95% CI -2.9 to 5.2; p=.59). Overall, self-esteem was significantly improved and depression scores were significantly lower at week 13. There was no significant difference in family or social functioning at week 13. ConclusionsWhile the findings provide some evidence for the integration of music therapy into clinical practice, differences relating to subgroups and secondary outcomes indicate the need for further study.

Recently, a new variant of the disease was reported and named TAFRO syndrome, an acronym for thrombocytopenia, ascites, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly. A 55-year-old woman presented to our hospital with dyspnea on exertion and high fever. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and proteinuria. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large anterior mediastinal mass, mild splenomegaly, bilateral pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and mild systemic lymphadenopathy. A CT-guided biopsy was unable to establish a definitive diagnosis, so we resected the mediastinal mass for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Pathological findings were consistent with the hyaline vascular type of Castleman's disease (CD), and she was diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome. There has been no description of a patient with TAFRO syndrome with a large mass, and this is the first case of TAFRO syndrome treated with debulking surgery.
2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 Violence; Media Violence; Movies; Homicide; Mass Media        	This article presents 2 studies of the association of media violence rates with societal violence rates. In the first study, movie violence and homicide rates are examined across the 20th century and into the 21st (1920-2005). Throughout the mid-20th century small-to-moderate correlational relationships can be observed between movie violence and homicide rates in the United States. This trend reversed in the early and latter 20th century, with movie violence rates inversely related to homicide rates. In the second study, videogame violence consumption is examined against youth violence rates in the previous 2 decades. Videogame consumption is associated with a decline in youth violence rates. Results suggest that societal consumption of media violence is not predictive of increased societal violence rates.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Aging; dielectric properties; electric motor; electric vehicle; winding insulation        	The electric motor is the heart of the electric vehicle. It is crucial that any occurring faults are detected promptly so that a catastrophic failure is avoided. At the same time, deep knowledge of the degradation mechanisms is required to allow maximum performance at minimum cost. This paper focuses on this balance. Statistical results from measurements of unaged and accelerated aged winding insulation samples provide information about the degradation processes, enabling steps toward a reliable prognosis model of the motor's remaining life.
0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 Endocrine Disruption; Bioinformatics; Gene Expression; Enrichment Analysis; Pathways of Toxicity        	The twenty-first century vision for toxicology involves a transition away from high-dose animal studies to in vitro and computational models (NRC in Toxicity testing in the 21st century: a vision and a strategy, The National Academies Press, Washington, DC, 2007). This transition requires mapping pathways of toxicity by understanding how in vitro systems respond to chemical perturbation. Uncovering transcription factors/signaling networks responsible for gene expression patterns is essential for defining pathways of toxicity, and ultimately, for determining the chemical modes of action through which a toxicant acts. Traditionally, transcription factor identification is achieved via chromatin immunoprecipitation studies and summarized by calculating which transcription factors are statistically associated with up- and downregulated genes. These lists are commonly determined via statistical or fold-change cutoffs, a procedure that is sensitive to statistical power and may not be as useful for determining transcription factor associations. To move away from an arbitrary statistical or fold-change-based cutoff, we developed, in the context of the Mapping the Human Toxome project, an enrichment paradigm called information-dependent enrichment analysis (IDEA) to guide identification of the transcription factor network. We used a test case of activation in MCF-7 cells by 17 beta estradiol (E2). Using this new approach, we established a time course for transcriptional and functional responses to E2. ER alpha and ER beta were associated with short-term transcriptional changes in response to E2. Sustained exposure led to recruitment of additional transcription factors and alteration of cell cycle machinery. TFAP2C and SOX2 were the transcription factors most highly correlated with dose. E2F7, E2F1, and Foxm1, which are involved in cell proliferation, were enriched only at 24 h. IDEA should be useful for identifying candidate pathways of toxicity. IDEA outperforms gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and provides similar results to weighted gene correlation network analysis, a platform that helps to identify genes not annotated to pathways.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 hedonic well-being; eudaimonic well-being; glucoregulation; cultural psychology; glycosylated hemoglobin        	Objective: To examine associations between glucoregulation and 3 categories of psychological resources: hedonic well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, positive affect), eudaimonic well-being (i.e., personal growth, purpose in life, ikigai), and interdependent well-being (i.e., gratitude, peaceful disengagement, adjustment) among Japanese adults. The question is important given increases in rates of type 2 diabetes in Japan in recent years, combined with the fact that most prior studies linking psychological resources to better physical health have utilized Western samples. Method: Data came from the Midlife in Japan Study involving randomly selected participants from the Tokyo metropolitan area, a subsample of whom completed biological data collection (N = 382; 56.0% female; M(SD)(age) = 55.5(14.0) years). Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was the outcome. Models adjusted for age, gender, educational attainment, smoking, alcohol, chronic conditions, body mass index (BMI), use of antidiabetic medication, and negative affect. Results: Purpose in life (beta = -.104, p = .021) was associated with lower HbA1c, and peaceful disengagement (beta = .129, p = .003) was associated with higher HbA1c in fully adjusted models. Comparable to the effects of BMI, a 1 standard deviation change in well-being was associated with a .1% change in HbA1c. Conclusions: Associations among psychological resources and glucoregulation were mixed. Healthy glucoregulation was evident among Japanese adults with higher levels of purpose in life and lower levels of peaceful disengagement, thereby extending prior research from the United States. The results emphasize the need for considering sociocultural contexts in which psychological resources are experienced in order to understand linkages to physical health.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Filtered back-projection (FBP); Parallel computing; distributed computing; 2D image reconstruction; Computed tomography (CT)        	Processing time has become increasingly a major factor in computed tomography, hence the need for reconstruction and real-time diagnostics. Since the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP) requires significantly intensive computational time when the amount of data becomes increasingly large; which is the case of computed tomography, parallel computing technique is used in Mat-Lab, as it enables the implementation of multi-tasking. Exploiting this advantage by partitioning the input data and allowing each core of cluster to work on its own sub-image. Therefore, FBP algorithm was applied simultaneously on all cores. All the reconstructed sub-images will be sent to client in order to be gathered. The comparison results between sequential FBP algorithm and parallel algorithm, show that the parallel computing process is up to seven times more efficient than the sequential algorithm on the voluminous images size, otherwise the small images results were poor because of the workers intercommunications that require times comparing with the sequential algorithm that takes a short computational time.
2	14	47	Psychology  	 Child abuse  	 adult survivors of child abuse; lung transplant; mortality        	Context: Psychosocial factors can impact lung transplant outcomes. However, it is currently unknown whether abuse survivorship influences lung transplant survival. Objective: To characterize the abuse history of adult lung transplant patients and determine whether such history is associated with mortality. Patients and Other Participants: Adult lung transplant recipients evaluated from 2000 to 2004. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome was post-lung transplantation survival. The secondary outcomes included demographic, transplantation, or psychological assessment differences between those with a history of abuse survivorship and those without. Results: Thirty-three lung transplant recipients (35.5% male, median age: 55 years) were included. A history of abuse survivorship was common (24.2%) and was associated with decreased survival following lung transplantation (P = .003). There was no difference in sex, marital status, or smoking history between abuse survivors and those who denied being the victim of abuse. Abuse survivors had a higher Personality Assessment Screener total score, a measure of maladaptive personality traits (P = .02). Conclusion: Abuse survivorship is common in lung transplant patients and associated with increased posttransplant mortality and increased maladaptive personality traits. This preliminary evidence suggests that lung transplant patients should be screened for abuse history and provided with appropriate treatment of survivorship issues to potentially improve their health outcomes from transplantation.

At the same time, suspension bridges, in view of their flexibility, are prone to aeroelastic response, such as vortex shedding, torsional divergence and flutter. In this paper, a non-linear dynamic model of a suspension bridge is devised, with the purpose of providing a first attempt toward a unified framework for the study of aeroelastic and internal resonance instabilities. Inspired by the pioneering work of Herrmann and Hauger, the analyses have been based on a linearized formulation that is able to represent the main structural non-linear effects and the coupling given by aerodynamic forces. The results confirm that the interaction between aeroelastic effects and non-linear internal resonance leads to unstable conditions for wind speeds which can be lower than the critical threshold for standard aeroelastic predictions.

In this commentary, I explicate these ""new biopolitical theories"" and propose a schema for operationalizing them for deductive analyses in ethnographic research. I illustrate the way this schema may be applied with examples from an ethnographic study on autism in Italy. In doing so, I provide a model of new biopolitical theory that can be used in future projects in a variety of research settings and put scholarship on biosocialities and biological citizenships in more explicit conversation with each other. Such robust conversation will further scholarly understanding of biopolitics in general and of the local particularity of biologies, biomedicines, and politics that affect them."
3	8	60	MAE 	 Strength of materials  	 Teaching process; Elasticity; Photoelasticity        	"In the new degree in Industrial Technology Engineering arising from the Bologna Process the education system takes a new approach placing the student in the centre of teaching-learning process. For that purpose, the lecturers have to innovate and improve their functions explaining the concepts in a more visual way turning the learning process attractive. Moreover, it is important to enhance the independent learning, focused on creation of the opportunities and experiences necessary for students to become capable, self-reliant, self-motivated and life-long learners. In this context, we have focused our attention on the basical subject called ""Elasticity and Strength of Materials"" given in third course. This topic provides the fundamental knowledge to deal with important fields in Mechanical Engineering such as Structural Analysis and Machine Design. Throughout the course, students become familiar with fundamental concepts of Structural Engineering and Mechanics, such as stress, strain, strength, stiffness and stability. The subject is divided into two parts. The first one discusses the theoretical foundations of the Theory of Elasticity, studying the stress and strain fields in an elastic solid subjected to a load system. In the second part the study is made for simplified models through the Strength of Materials. Over the years of teaching it has been noticed that students have more difficulties to understand and learn the first part, which is more abstract and less intuitive. In order to enhance the curriculum development of students and complement the theoretical basis explained in the lectures, we will use a photoelasticity device which is available to the students during the workshop practices of ""Elasticity and Strength of Materials"". Photoelasticity is an experimental non-destructive technique that evaluates stresses and strains in an elastic solid through the optical refraction appearing in a particular material subjected to mechanical loads. This technique requires very few resources, making it very suitable for teaching in small labs. In those teaching practices, the students are invited to reproduce physically some of the problems analytically raised and solved in class, and they can see the stress and strain results for different points of the particular solid through different colors, which is more visual and attractive. Furthermore, this practice is conceived as a multidisciplinary task since it is offered the students the opportunity to resolve the problem by Finite Element Analysis, which is addressed in subsequent courses. The students are divided in different groups to solve analytically and experimentally different case problems and they gain new skills and abilities in the field of Mechanical Engineering, improving problem-solving competences and promoting the teamwork and the cooperativity among students. In that way, productive and enriching discussion is encouraged through the comparison between theoretical results and experimental reality, improving the reasoning and the critical spirit of the students."
2	17	50	Psychology  	 Attention  	 NGQDs-ZIINb(2)O(6)/g-C3N4; Heterostructures; Hydrogen; Photocatalysts        	The development of efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for water splitting has drawn much attention. Herein, we demonstrated a novel H-2-producing photocatalytic system that employed nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs)-ZnNb2O6/g-C3N4 heterostructures as the hydrogen evolving catalysts. The as-prepared NGQDs-ZnNb2O6/g-C3N4 heterostructures were favorable for light harvesting and charge separation, and showed highly efficient photocatalytic performance for water splitting into hydrogen. Results showed that both the ZnNb2O6/g-C3N4 (Zn/CN) mole ratio and the amount of NGQDs displayed important influence for H-2 production. Moreover, the optimum synthesis conditions of the Zn/CN mole ratio (1/7) and the amount of NGQDs (5%) were both obtained, and the corresponding 5%NGQDs-Zn/7CN sample performed a much higher hydrogen-evolution rate of 340.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). By the further studies, the enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the crucial roles of NGQDs and heterojunction photocatalytic system, which resulted in an efficient charge separation and the largely enhanced photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the possible photocatalytic mechanism of NGQDs-ZnNb2O6/g-C3N4 was also proposed. We envision that this work creates new opportunities for constructing and designing efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.
5	8	80	Medical 	 Autism  	 epidemiology; psychopathology; maternal age; paternal age; parental age        	Objective: Increasing evidence implicates advanced paternal age at offspring birth in neuropsychiatric disorders. Advanced maternal age has also been associated with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas younger maternal age has been linked with behavioral disorders. Few studies have considered the specificity of the associations with respect to comorbidity. In addition, most prior studies have been conducted in clinical samples or registries that may reflect more severe forms of psychopathology. The aim of this research is to examine the independent and joint associations of maternal and paternal age with specific subtypes of psychopathology in offspring in a pediatric sample of adolescents with emergent psychiatric syndromes. Method: A total of 8,725 youths (aged 8-21 years) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort were included in the analyses. Logistic regression models with parental age predicting offspring psychopathology were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and comorbid disorders. Results: We found that younger parental ages were generally associated with increased rates of offspring psychopathology. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidity, both younger maternal and paternal ages were associated with behavior syndromes and psychosis in youth, whereas advanced paternal age was associated with pervasive developmental disorders/autism spectrum disorder (PDD/ASD). Conclusion: These findings suggest that both younger and older parental age at birth are associated with specific forms of psychopathology in offspring. The persistence of the influence of parental age after control for demographic factors and an index of social environment suggests that additional explanations for these findings should be examined in future studies.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Autism spectrum disorder; Intervention; ABCX; Integrated care; Family        	This conceptual paper reviews the need for a family-focused service delivery model within the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) field and suggests that the Double ABCX Model of Stress and Adaptation is a way to address this need. Within the ASD field, there is an absence of service delivery models that are able to address the needs of the family as a unit, rather than the individual child with ASD. This gap is striking given the reciprocal relationship between parent and child outcomes within the ASD field. To support our argument that the Double ABCX model could be used to integrate parent and child-focused interventions within the ASD field, this paper starts by reviewing the mental health outcomes often associated with having a child with ASD. We next provide a historical overview of the Double ABCX model and review a body of ASD intervention literature within the context of the Double ABCX model framework. Doing so shows that a number of child and parent focused interventions within the ASD field can be fit within the Double ABCX framework. However, a handful of methodological and sampling limitations prevent the Double ABCX model from being fully supported as a model that could be applied in a variety of settings. Taken together, this review highlights that the Double ABCX model is a promising strategy to integrate child and parent-focused interventions within the ASD field, but highlights that specific areas of future research are needed in order to build continued support for this argument.

The proposed technique enhances the ability to build sparse parallel solvers for circuit simulation matrices. Thus the proposed technique improves the performance of circuit simulation algorithms. The new technique represents sparse linear system as a signal flow graph. Then it divides the graph into separate strongly connected components SCC. SCCs relations are represented and used to enhance the parallelism of the solver.
0	6	6	CS 	 Image processing  	 Micro-distance imaging technology; Droplet sizes; Measurement in the field; Reduction in cost        	A measurement system was developed using micro-distance imaging technology to measure droplet sizes in the field. Legible droplet images were acquired with a single-lens reflex camera, a micro-distance lens and illumination source in the proper parameters. The droplets were extracted effectively based on the background subtraction, region-growing repair, shape-factor screening and concave points matching methods. The droplet characterizations, including projective area, diameter and volume were calculated using MATLAB image processing technology. The system displayed droplet sizes and distribution regulation in graphs that were convenient for obtaining experimental regulation. Indoor comparison experiments between the developed system and oil disk method was conducted, and the average relative errors were 6.03%, 5.50% and 6.25% for D-V (0.1), D-V 0.5, D-V 0.9, respectively. Field comparison experiments revealed that the relative error was 5.61% between the developed system and the oil disk method and 6.88% between the developed system and the laser instrument method. Application experiments in the field were conducted and the result revealed that fine droplets had better penetration than coarse droplets in the tree canopy. The system was simple in structure, had a lower cost compared with some instruments and reduced experimental time compared with the image processing methods that use oil disks. It has a good prospect for use. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 Binding; Context memory; Destination memory; Episodic memory; Schizophrenia        	"Destination memory refers to the ability to remember to whom a piece of information was previously transmitted. Our paper assessed this ability in schizophrenia. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia and 25 control participants told proverbs (e.g., ""send a thief to catch a thief"") to pictures of celebrities (e.g., Elvis Presley). Afterward, participants had to indicate to which celebrity they had previously said the proverbs. Participants also completed a binding task in which they were required to associate letters with their corresponding context (i.e., location). Analysis revealed worse destination memory and binding in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. In both populations, destination memory was significantly correlated with performances on the binding task. Our findings suggest difficulty in the ability to attribute information to its appropriate destination in schizophrenia. This difficulty may be related to compromise in binding separate cues together to form a coherent representation of an event in memory."

1	2	19	ECE 	 Electrical circuits  	 Microbial desalination cell; Decoupling; Electrical connection; Bioelectricity        	To improve the flexibility of microbial desalination cell (MDC) construction and operation, a new configuration with decoupled anode and cathode was developed and examined in this study. A higher salt concentration resulted in higher current generation, as well as a higher salt removal rate. The effect of the distance between the anode and the cathode on the MDC performance was not obvious, likely due to a sufficient conductivity in the salt solution. Because the cathode was identified as a limiting factor, adding one more cathode unit increased the current generation from 723 to 116.0 A/m(3), while installing additional anode units did not obviously alter the MDC current production. Changing the position of the anode/cathode units exhibited a weak influence on the MDC performance. Parallel connection of electrical circuits generally produced more current than the individual connections, and a strong competition was observed between multiple units sharing the same opposite unit.

5	49	121	Medical 	 Smoking Cessation  	 Smoking; Tobacco; Nicotine replacement therapy; Smoking; cessation; Adherence; Free distribution        	Introduction: There is growing evidence that the mailed distribution of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), usually as part of smokers' helplines, can been effective in increasing the odds of cessation on a population level. However, limited information is available on the utilization of NRT when it is provided for free, and factors associated with regimen adherence have remained largely Unexplored. Methods: In the context of a randomized controlled trial, 500 adult smokers across Canada hypothetically interested in free NRT were mailed a 5 week supply of nicotine patches, but no tither support was offered. Analyses evaluated which a priori-defined demographic and smoking characteristics predicted nicotine patch use at 8 week follow-up of 421 patch recipients, as well as examined the association between patch use and smoking cessation at 6 months. Results: At 8 weeks, 10.9% had used all, 47.5% had used some but not all, and 41.6% had not used any of the provided nicotine patches. Lower age, unemployment, past NRT use and intent to quit in the next 30 days at baseline (preparation stage of change) were all identified as independent predictors of some nicotine patch use. Only use of all patches was associated with greater odds of smoking cessation, compared to non-users (Adj. OR = 2.96; 95%CI = 1.06-8.27). Conclusions: The mailed distribution of free nicotine patches to smokers at large can be effective at promoting cessation, particularly among financially disadvantaged groups, those with previous NRT experience and among individuals with already advanced intent to quit.

5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Pediatric anxiety; treatment response; neuroimaging; attention; emotion processing        	BackgroundApproximately 40%-45% of youth with anxiety disorders do not achieve remission (or a substantial reduction in symptoms) following treatment, highlighting the need to identify predictors of treatment response. Given the well-established link between attentional biases and anxiety disorders in youth and adults, this study examined the neural correlates of directing attention toward and away from emotional faces in relation to pediatric anxiety treatment response. MethodPrior to beginning treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), 37 youth (age 7-19years) with generalized and/or social anxiety disorder completed a task with conditions that manipulated whether participants were instructed to match emotional faces (explicit emotion processing) or match shapes in the context of emotional face distractors (implicit emotion processing) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. ResultsResults revealed that reduced activation in superior frontal gyrus (SFG), encompassing the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), during implicit processing of emotional faces predicted a greater reduction in anxiety severity pre-to-post treatment. Post hoc analyses indicated that effects were not significantly moderated by the type of treatment or anxiety type. ConclusionsFindings suggest that less recruitment of SFG, including the dorsal ACC and dorsomedial PFC, during implicit emotion processing predicts a greater reduction in youth anxiety symptoms pre-to-post treatment. Youth who exhibit reduced activation in these areas while matching shapes in the context of emotional face distractors may have more to gain from CBT and SSRI treatment due to preexisting deficits in attentional control. These findings suggest that neuroimaging may be a useful tool for predicting which youth are most likely to benefit from anxiety treatment.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 anti-arrhythmia agents; drug therapy; genetic testing; genetics; genomics; pharmacogenetics; torsade de pointes        	BACKGROUND: Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject's drug-induced increase in heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration. RESULTS: The genetic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (r=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.81; P=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (r=0.48; 95% confidence interval, -0.03 to 0.79; P=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (r=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.80; P=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (r(2)=12%, P=1x10(-7)). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in drug-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of drug-induced torsade de pointes. These findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies. Replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive these effects.
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Interleaved converter; Current reconstruction; Single current sensor; Digital control        	This paper proposes a new phase current reconstruction technique for interleaved three-phase bidirectional dc-dc converters using a single current sensor. In the proposed current reconstruction algorithm, a single current sensor is employed at the dc-link, and the dc-link current information is sampled at either the peak or valley point of the pulse-width modulation (PWM) carriers regularly. From the obtained current information, all phase currents are reconstructed in a single PWM cycle. After that, the digital current controller is applied to achieve current balancing in each phase. Compare to the previous multiple current sensor method, the proposed strategy reduces the number of the current sensors in the interleaved three-phase bidirectional converter as well as reducing potential current sensing error caused by non-ideal characteristics of the multiple current sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified from the experiments based on a 3kW three-phase bidirectional converter prototype for the automotive battery charging application.
0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 uterus; oxytocin; ritodrine; reproductive pharmacology; metabolomics; bioinformatics        	In recent times, additional pathways involved in the regulation of the myometrium have been suggested. This also holds true for the effect of drugs such as oxytocin (OT) and -adrenergic agonists on the myometrium. Knowledge of these additional pathways will certainly prove useful in designing better therapies for pathologies of the myometrium. This study was therefore aimed at investigating the possibility of other pathways involved in the activities of both OT and ritodrine (RIT; a -adrenergic agonist) in the myometrium by utilizing metabolomics and bioinformatics. High-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (HRFTMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with functional uterine assays were used for an innovative assessment. In vitro pharmacological assay of OT (1 nmol/L) and RIT (0.1 nmol/L) on isolated mice uteri mounted in 3 mL organ baths was performed. Mice uteri, treated with OT or RIT, as well as the physiological buffer in which the uterine tissues were immersed, were rapidly collected and analyzed using HRFTMS, proton (H-1)-NMR, and bioinformatics. Resulting data were analyzed via pairwise chemometric comparison models, with P .05 considered statistically significant. In addition to previously known metabolites, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, -aminobutyric acid, and sphingosine were significantly associated with the activity of OT, whereas the activity of RIT was associated with a downstream involvement of prostaglandin F-1 and phosphatidylinositol signaling. These findings add evidence to the reports on additional regulation of myometrial activity by these drugs and suggest newer pathways for therapeutic manipulation.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 ER stress; Unfolded Protein Responses; IRE1; XBP1; PERK; CHOP; Myeloid cells; Immunotherapy; Tumor immunology        	"Established tumors build a stressful and hostile microenvironment that blocks the development of protective innate and adaptive immune responses. Different subsets of immunoregulatory myeloid populations, including dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages, accumulate in the stressed tumor milieu and represent a major impediment to the success of various forms of cancer immunotherapy. Specific conditions and factors within tumor masses, including hypoxia, nutrient starvation, low pH, and increased levels of free radicals, provoke a state of ""endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress"" in both malignant cells and infiltrating myeloid cells. In order to cope with ER stress, cancer cells and tumor-associated myeloid cells activate an integrated signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which promotes cell survival and adaptation under adverse environmental conditions. However, the UPR can also induce cell death under unresolved levels of ER stress. Three branches of the UPR have been described, including the activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), the pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In this minireview, we briefly discuss the role of ER stress and specific UPR mediators in tumor development, growth and metastasis. In addition, we describe how sustained ER stress responses operate as key mediators of chronic inflammation and immune suppression within tumors. Finally, we discuss multiple pharmacological approaches that overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the UPR in tumors, and that could potentially enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies by reprogramming the function of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells."
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 face recognition; distributed SVM classifier; embedded device        	Face recognition has been widely used in many application areas such as photo album management and information security. Rapid growth of handheld devices and social networks bring new challenges to face recognition algorithm design and system engineering. To be effective on a handheld device, the face recognition model must be simple and lightweight, and also needs to handle the large variations in background, image size, etc. This paper tries to address these two problems from a system perspective. We employ a simple linear model for face recognition, which is generated from a SVM classifier to tell whether a pair of face is from the same subject or not. And to make this classifier generalized well on all potential inter-face/intra-face variations, we train it with billions of face pairs. Many potential problems arise during the large-scale training procedure. For examples, 1) the training set is too large to fit into a single machine; 2) the computation requirement is so huge that it takes many days to complete a training which makes difficult for algorithm developers to experiment and tune the model effectively. To overcome these obstacles, this paper proposes a large-scale face recognition training system, called LFRTrainer. The system takes advantage of the massive data parallelism available in the problem and utilizes a distributed compute cluster to perform the model training. We have run this system on Intel Endeavor cluster for model development and tuning over a year. Using LFRTrainer, we train a face recognition model for embedded devices which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high scalability: 92.2% Face Verification Rate (FVR) at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) on FRGC- 204 benchmark and nearly linear scalability from tens to hundreds of nodes.

This study describes a fuzzy logic-based improved loss minimisation technique for the BLDC motor drive system. The proposed algorithm uses selective harmonic elimination-based pulse-width modulation to optimise both the converter switching losses along with machine core and copper losses based on a speed- and load-dependent fuzzy rule matrix. The optimum switching angles eliminating lower-order harmonics are calculated offline and stored in microcontroller memory for online application. The suitability of the proposed control is well demonstrated through simulation and experimental results on a practical 350 W BLDC machine.
5	50	122	Medical 	 Sports Injuries  	 distal radius fracture; wrist fractures; sports-related injuries        	Sports-related distal radius fractures (SRDRF) represent 12.5% of all fractures affecting the upper extremity. This type of fracture occurs more frequently in males (76%) than in females (24%), with an average age of presentation of 24.5 years. In the pediatric population, the peak incidence for sports injuries is between 11 and 17 years. High-impact sports, such as football, basketball, and soccer carry an especially high risk for this type of injury. However, because of the wide variety of sport disciplines and different characteristics in demand, velocity, energy, and use of the upper extremities, there is no uniform pattern of SRDRF. The general principles for diagnosis and treatment of distal radius fractures in athletes, for the most part, follow those of the general population. However, unique aspects of the clinical approach to SRDRF in the athlete frequently require additional radiographic views and the common need for advanced imaging such as computer tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. Athletes constitute a special patient population. Elite athletes are highly motivated to return to competition as soon as possible, frequently being willing to accept the risk of poor healing or repeat injury The treating physician may be subjected to pressure to prematurely end immobilization, reduce recovery time, and even remove plates or alter therapy based on competition requirements. These influences should be mitigated in favor of the long-term benefit for the patient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 electric spindle; torque density; inverted inter permanent magnet machines; skewing; torque ripple        	In recent years, high speed direct drive spindle motors are obtaining more and more attentions due to their compact structure, high efficiency, low vibration and noise. Compared with those of high speed machines used for electric vehicles (EV) and refrigerator compressors, the shaft of a spindle motor is always thicker to satisfy the mechanical support requirement. When the overall outer diameter of a spindle motor is further limited for practical use, the rotor space will be restricted on both the inner and outer side, which makes the machine design process a more challenging work. This paper presents a detailed design procedure of a high speed interior PM spindle permanent magnet (PM) motor. With large volume consumption for the shaft, the rotor space is fully utilized by adopting the inverted interior V shaped PM rotor structure. Firstly, the split ratio is optimized for maximum torque density. Then, the rotor parameters, including the magnet thickness, PM pole arc, angle between adjacent PMs and the bridge width are optimized by finite element analysis (FEA). The simulated results show significant improvement on output performance, i.e. the torque density is increased by 22%. Finally, the analysis results are verified by experimental tests on a 11 Nm, 12000RPM prototype machine.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 antagonist; bipolar depression; glutamate; monotherapy; riluzole        	Background: Glutamatergic system abnormalities are implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of both major depressive disorder and bipolar depression (BDep). Subsequent to studies demonstrating the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, other glutamatergic modulators are now being studied in clinical trials of mood disorders. A previous open-label study found that riluzole, administered in combination with the mood stabilizer lithium, had antidepressant effects. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of riluzole monotherapy for the treatment of BDep. Nineteen subjects aged 18 to 70 years with bipolar disorder currently experiencing a depressive episode were tapered off of excluded medications and randomized to receive riluzole (50-200 mg/d) or placebo for 8 weeks. Rating scale scores (Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Young Mania Rating Scale) were obtained weekly. Results: No significant differences in depressive symptoms were observed between subjects treated with riluzole and those receiving placebo (P = 0.12). Anxiety scores were significantly lower in the placebo group (P = 0.046). An interim analysis was conducted that resulted in stopping the study because of futility; no subjects had achieved treatment response. Conclusions: Although we found no change in severity of depressive symptoms in BDep patients receiving riluzole compared with placebo, this trial was limited by the relatively high number of subject withdrawals and the small sample size. Thus, while riluzole monotherapy did not demonstrate efficacy for BDep, further studies examining riluzole as adjunctive therapy for this disorder may be warranted.

Methods: A cross-sectional investigation was performed on 1,502 postmenopausal women attending the outpatient service for menopause at a University Hospital. Data regarding climacteric symptoms, evaluated by the Greene Climacteric Scale, objective pelvic floor defects, and UI of any type, were retrieved from an electronic database. Additional information retrieved were age, anthropometric measures, personal and reproductive history, use of medication or drugs, smoking, state of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scale score), and depression (Zung's scale score). Results: The score of the Greene Climacteric Scale was higher (P = 0.0001) in women with (n = 534) than without (n = 902) UI (32.3 +/- 13.1 vs 26.5 +/- 12.5; P < 0.0011). The same was true when considering stress (n = 370) (31.4 +/- 13.4; P = 0.0007), urge (n = 84) (34.5 +/- 13.5; P = 0.005), or mixed (n = 89) (34.3 +/- 11.4; P = 0.006) UI. In multiple logistic regression models, the Greene climacteric score was independently related to UI (odds ratio [OR] 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07), along with the presence of a bladder prolapse (OR 3.72; 95% CI, 2.59-5.34), age at menopause (OR 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09), and previous hysterectomy (OR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08-3.01). Women in the fourth quartile of the Greene Climacteric Scale score had an OR of UI of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.5-2.9). Conclusions: In postmenopausal women, higher symptom burden, as captured by the Greene Climacteric Scale, relates to UI. Underlying mechanisms were not assessed, and deserve further investigation.
3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 Negative Impedance Converter (NIC); stability; network Nyquist test; electrically small antennas        	Negative impedance converters (NICs) have been proposed as structures to improve the performance of RF circuits and electrically small antennas. However, NICs suffer from stability problems. This paper presents a compact procedure to analyze the stability of NICs. Then, the required and sufficient conditions to predict the stability of a negative impedance converter are given. These conditions can be evaluated using standard computer-aided design software. Finally, a NIC prototype is given to validate and illustrate the presented design procedure, it is also integrated with a printed, blade-type, electrically small monopole in the VHF band.
2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 Word recognition; Associative spreading; Multiple Read-Out Model (MROM); Semantic process model; Episodic memory        	Interactive activation and competition models (IAMs) cannot only account for behavioral data from implicit memory tasks, but also for brain data. We start by a discussion of standards for developing and evaluating cognitive models, followed by example demonstrations. In doing so, we relate IAM representations to word length, sequence, frequency, repetition, and orthographic neighborhood effects in behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies along the ventral visual stream. We then examine to what extent lexical competition can account for anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation and the N2/N400 complex. The subsequent section presents the Associative Read-Out Model (AROM), which extends the scope of IAMs by introducing explicit memory and semantic representations. Thereby, it can account for false memories, and familiarity and recollection - explaining why memory signal variances are greater for studied than non-studied items. Since the AROM captures associative spreading across semantic long-term memory, it can also account for different temporal lobe functions, and allows for item-level predictions of the left inferior frontal gyrus' BOLD response. Finally, we use the AROM to examine whether semantic cohesiveness can account for effects previously ascribed to affective word features, i.e. emotional valence, and show that this is the case for positive, but not for negative valence.

5	36	108	Medical 	 Multiple Sclerosis  	 APRIL; BAFF; family case; IgA; immune deficiency; TACI        	Introduction: The most common humoral immunodeficiency is IgA deficiency. One of the first papers addressing the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IgA deficiency indicated that immature IgA-positive B-lymphocytes are present in these patients. This suggests that the genetic background for IgA is still intact and that class switching can take place. At this moment, it cannot be ruled out that genetic as well as environmental factors are involved.Areas covered: A clinical presentation, the biological functions of IgA, and the management of IgA deficiency are reviewed. In some IgA deficient patients, a relationship with a loss-of-function mutation in the TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand interaction) gene has been found. Many other genes also have been associated. Gut microbiota are an important environmental trigger for IgA synthesis.Expert commentary: Expression of IgA deficiency is due to both genetic and environmental factors and a role for gut microbiota cannot be excluded.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 Crohn's disease; inflammatory bowel disease; meta-analysis; oral health; periodontal disease; systematic review; ulcerative colitis        	BackgroundThe objective of this systematic review was to systematically investigate whether there is an association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and oral health. MethodsLiterature searches for randomized and non-randomized studies were performed up to January 2017. Risk of bias within studies was assessed with the Downs and Black checklist. Across-studies risk of bias was assessed with the GRADE framework. Quantitative synthesis was conducted with random-effects meta-analyses. ResultsA total of 9 cross-sectional studies including 1297 patients were included. IBD was associated with increased risk of periodontitis (332 more patients per 1000 patients; 95% confidence interval (CI): 257-388 patients; p<0.001) compared to non-IBD patients. Additionally, the Decayed-Missing-Filled-Teeth index of IBD patients was significantly worse than non-IBD patients (mean difference: 3.85; 95% CI: 2.36-5.34; p=0.005). Patients with ulcerative colitis had considerably worse oral health for most of the assessed factors, while the quality of overall evidence ranged from high to low, due to the observational nature of contributing studies. ConclusionsInflammatory bowel disease was associated with significantly higher risk of periodontitis and worse oral health compared to non-IBD patients. However, longitudinal studies are needed in order to establish a causality link between IBD and periodontal disease.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 Combination effects; Gallic acid; Ascorbic acid; Fructose; Oxidation; Advanced glycation end products        	Background: Dietary plant-based foods contain combinations of various bioactive compounds such as phytochemical compounds and vitamins. The combined effect of these vitamins and phytochemicals remains unknown, especially in the prevention of diabetes and its complications. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effect of ascorbic acid and gallic acid on fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidation. Results: Ascorbic acid (15 mu g/mL) and gallic acid (0.1 mu g/mL) reduced fructose-induced formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in bovine serum albumin (BSA; 10 mg/mL) by 15.06% and 37.83%, respectively. The combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid demonstrated additive inhibition on the formation of AGEs after 2 weeks of incubation. In addition, synergistic inhibition on the formation of amyloid cross-beta structure and protein carbonyl content in fructose-glycated BSA was observed. At the same concentration, the combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid produced a significant additive effect on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity. Conclusion: Combining natural compounds such as ascorbic acid and gallic acid seems to be a promising strategy to prevent the formation of AGEs.

2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Case study; Data analytics; Energy consumption; Leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED); Regression analysis; Research facilities; Sustainable construction        	During the last decade, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has embodied the efforts of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) to recognize buildings designed to achieve superior performance in several areas including energy consumption. Given the emergent interest in improving buildings' energy efficiency, researchers have generated predictive physical and data-driven models for energy consumption. Although the physical approaches aiming to calculate the energy consumption behavior at the building level are accurate, the necessity of continuously inspecting and gathering data for all the input parameters often makes these approaches impractical in some applications. The objective of this study is to introduce a novel assessment method that investigates the correlation between LEED certification and the actual energy consumption by investigating a case study of LEED-certified research buildings in climate zone 2B. The research approach first consists of developing and testing eight performance models for 13 non-LEED buildings, and then inspecting the fit of the best model to five comparable LEED certified buildings. Heating, cooling, and electricity data are collected from all buildings, in addition to multiple weather, time, and building characteristics variables. The data are used to generate several regression models that predict the energy consumption of conventional research buildings. The results show the differences in energy use between LEED and non-LEED buildings are not as large as anticipated. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by first introducing a novel generic assessment method for LEED buildings and second applying this method to a case study sample of LEED-certified research buildings in climate zone 2B. The findings of this paper support the actual performance assessment of LEED buildings by helping practitioners make better decisions throughout the project life. In order to ensure a fair and representative assessment of the LEED certification system, future studies are invited to adopt this new method while comparing the actual performance of LEED buildings to that of non-LEED +buildings.

0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Semantic framework; Abstraction layer; Application programming interface; Object-oriented paradigm; Mapping; Middleware; Software; Software engineering; Triplestore; Ontology; RDF; SPARQL        	This work describes a system for the automatic generation of full-fledged API layers from RDF schemas, providing the whole set of Object-Oriented functionalities to retrieve, store, edit and delete the corresponding data in a semantic Triplestore. The layers the system is capable of producing range from an underlying domain model, resulting from the classes, data properties and object properties of the input schema, to the related lower-level data source and access components, up to higher-level facades and web service interfaces, all of which are immediately operational and can be used out-of-the-box for development purposes either as stand-alone components or integrated into external applications. A user-friendly graphical interface allows for an easy configuration and customization of the generation process to suit specific development needs. Once configured, the execution of the generation process takes place almost instantaneously, bringing about a full set of API components in a matter of seconds and thus dramatically saving design and development time and effort. Experimentation of the system has been carried out within the context of a EU-funded research project featuring a large semantic schema, a significant portion of which represented a Learning Model specifically engineered to be used for a plethora of e-learning solutions; nevertheless, the system is generic enough to be employed for a variety of applications relying upon semantic schemas and data.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Coastal ocean circulation model; Parallel computing; Domain decomposition; Integer linear programming; Urban ocean; ECOM        	This paper presents a new parallel domain decomposition algorithm based on integer linear programming (ILP), a mathematical optimization method. To minimize the computation time of coastal ocean circulation models, the ILP decomposition algorithm divides the global domain in local domains with balanced work load according to the number of processors and avoids computations over as many as land grid cells as possible. In addition, it maintains the use of logically rectangular local domains and achieves the exact same results as traditional domain decomposition algorithms (such as Cartesian decomposition). However, the ILP decomposition algorithm may not converge to an exact solution for relatively large domains. To overcome this problem, we developed two ILP decomposition formulations. The first one (complete formulation) has no additional restriction, although it is impractical for large global domains. The second one (feasible) imposes local domains with the same dimensions and looks for the feasibility of such decomposition, which allows much larger global domains. Parallel performance of both ILP formulations is compared to a base Cartesian decomposition by simulating two cases with the newly created parallel version of the Stevens Institute of Technology's Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Model (sECOM). Simulations with the ILP formulations run always faster than the ones with the base decomposition, and the complete formulation is better than the feasible one when it is applicable. In addition, parallel efficiency with the ILP decomposition may be greater than one.
3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 Isogeometric analysis; Neutron diffusion; NURBS; Finite elements; Bubnov-Galerkin        	Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) has been applied to heterogeneous reactor physics problems using the multi group neutron diffusion equation. IGA uses a computer-aided design (CAD) description of the geometry commonly built from Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), which can exactly represent complicated curved shapes such as circles and cylinders, common features in reactor design. This work has focused on comparing IGA to finite element analysis (FEA) for heterogeneous reactor physics problems, including the OECD/NEA C5G7 LWR benchmark. The exact geometry and increased basis function continuity contribute to the accuracy of IGA and an improvement over comparable FEA calculations has been observed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Kangaroo mother care; Skin to skin care; Health system integration; Mother; Father; Family; Caregiver        	Background: Despite improvements in child survival in the past four decades, an estimated 6.3 million children under the age of five die each year, and more than 40% of these deaths occur in the neonatal period. Interventions to reduce neonatal mortality are needed. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is one such life-saving intervention; however it has not yet been fully integrated into health systems around the world. Utilizing a conceptual framework for integration of targeted health interventions into health systems, we hypothesize that caregivers play a critical role in the adoption, diffusion, and assimilation of KMC. The objective of this research was to identify barriers and enablers of implementation and scale up of KMC from caregivers' perspective. Methods: We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and WHO regional databases using search terms 'kangaroo mother care' or 'kangaroo care' or 'skin to skin care'. Studies published between January 1, 1960 and August 19, 2015 were included. To be eligible, published work had to be based on primary data collection regarding barriers or enablers of KMC implementation from the family perspective. Abstracted data were linked to the conceptual framework using a deductive approach, and themes were identified within each of the five framework areas using Nvivo software. Results: We identified a total of 2875 abstracts. After removing duplicates and ineligible studies, 98 were included in the analysis. The majority of publications were published within the past 5 years, had a sample size less than 50, and recruited participants from health facilities. Approximately one-third of the studies were conducted in the Americas, and 26.5% were conducted in Africa. We identified four themes surrounding the interaction between families and the KMC intervention: buy in and bonding (i.e. benefits of KMC to mothers and infants and perceptions of bonding between mother and infant), social support (i.e. assistance from other people to perform KMC), sufficient time to perform KMC, and medical concerns about mother or newborn health. Furthermore, we identified barriers and enablers of KMC adoption by caregivers within the context of the health system regarding financing and service delivery. Embedded within the broad social context, barriers to KMC adoption by caregivers included adherence to traditional newborn practices, stigma surrounding having a preterm infant, and gender roles regarding childcare. Conclusion: Efforts to scale up and integrate KMC into health systems must reduce barriers in order to promote the uptake of the intervention by caregivers.
5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Proximal Humerus Fractures; Percutaneous Pinning; Open Reduction and Internal Fixation; Constant-Murley Score; Neer's Classification        	BACKGROUND Proximal humerus fractures remain challenging to the treating orthopaedist in both their initial diagnosis and classification and in their corresponding management. They account for approximately 5% of all fractures, 1,2 and their incidence is expected to increase secondary to an ageing population and the associated osteoporosis.(3,4,5,6) These fractures are the third most common type of fragility fractures after distal radius and hip fractures in patients aged 65 years and above. MATERIALS AND METHODS In our study, 42 patients were treated and followed for a period of 2 years from July 2014 to July 2016 in Department of Orthopaedics, Siddhartha Medical College, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. In our study, 42 patients were treated with PHILOS locking plate and their intra and postoperative period followup done for 2 years; outcome of patients, complications studied throughout this period. RESULTS In our study, 42 cases treated with locking plates, age incidence most common in 41-50 years age group, more common in males (34 cases), more common on right side (31 cases). In our study, maximum number of cases belong to Neer's 2-part surgical neck of humerus fractures (24 out of 42 cases) followed by fracture dislocations (9 out of 42 cases) and three-part fractures (8 out of 42 cases). Mean followup of our study was 18.9 months ranging from 9 months to 24 months. Average time for union was 12.5 weeks in our study ranging from 12 weeks to 14 weeks. Out of 42 cases we have operated 28 cases within 7 days of injury and 8 cases within 7-14 days and remaining 6 cases after 14 days due to delay in presentation to us. Adequate reduction is achieved in 32 cases out of 42 cases. Mean Neck shaft angle calculated on immediate postoperative radiographs was 136.3 degrees and mean angle after fracture healing was 131.6 degrees. There was a mean 4.7 degrees varus collapse (mean fall of Neck shaft angle) from initial fixation to fracture healing in our study. Range of motion was affected by increasing age in our study, best range of motion was found in age group of 20-30 years with a mean of 136 degrees forward flexion, 133 degrees abduction, 85 degrees of external rotation and 86 degrees of internal rotation. Range of motion reduced with advancing age in our study can be explained by the age related rotator cuff dysfunction. Results were evaluated based on the Constant Murley Score and DASH shoulder scoring systems. In 86% of cases, there was excellent to good results & fair results in 12% cases. There were two percent poor results in our study. CONCLUSION In our study, we conclude that locking plates minimise the possible complications like screw loosening, screw back-out and varus collapse associated with traditional plates. Significant improvement in functional outcome is seen with locking plates due to early mobilisation of shoulder. Functional outcome is directly proportional to the reconstruction and functioning of rotator cuff and proper rehabilitation.

5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 Familial hypercholesterolaemia; Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia; LDLR gene; APOB gene; PCSK9 gene        	Purpose of Review Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which is characterised by a raised cholesterol level from birth and a high risk of premature coronary heart disease. In this paper, we review the genetic basis of FH and its impact on the clinical presentation. Recent Findings Mutations in any of three genes (LDLR, APOB and PCSK9) are known to cause autosomal dominant FH, but a mutation can be found in only similar to 40% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH. In the remainder, a polygenic aetiology is most likely, due to the co-inheritance of common LDL-C-raising variants. The cardiovascular presentation and management of FH will differ between patients based on their underlying genetic factors. Summary New genotyping methods such as next-generation sequencing will provide us with better understanding of the genetic architecture of FH.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 hormonophobia; Combined oral contraceptives; hormonal replacement therapy; menopausal syndrome        	Of the total number of 45-69 years old women in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the frequency of use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs does not tend to increase and remains at a low level amounting to only 0.8% in 2010 and 0.9% in 2013. Frequency of HRT drugs use among women who are obstetricians and gynecologists from different regions of Kazakhstan between the ages of 45 to 69 years old was only 10% in 2008 and 14% in 2013. The reasons for low use of HRT among obstetricians and gynecologists were associated with fear of cancer, obesity, thromboembolism and stroke. Moreover, this information is supported by other doctors, especially oncologists and endocrinologists. There is low use of different types of contraceptives for the prevention of unwanted pregnancy. Thus, contraceptives were used by 30.4% of women of reproductive age in 2000, and by 38.2% in 2012. Frequency of use of hormonal contraceptives remains at extremely low levels with a slight increase from 1.8% in 2004 to 2.2% in 2013, which has resulted in the fact that abortion remains primary birth control method. Low use of hormonal contraception methods and HRT drugs indicates hormonophobia among doctors of all specializations. There is a need to increase the knowledge of obstetrician-gynecologists, internists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, urologists, and healthy living office employees in urban clinics of modern methods of contraception, and nosotropic therapy for menopausal symptoms with the use of HRT drugs.
5	3	75	Medical 	 Ankylosing Spondylitis  	 ankylosing spondylitis; CSF2; rs657075; Bath AS Global (BAS-G); single nucleotide polymorphism        	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic autoimmune disease mainly affecting the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints, and exhibits peripheral inflammatory arthropathy. More than 25 loci have been identified as associated with AS. Because both AS and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are autoimmune diseases that may share some common genetic factors, we therefore examined if the newly identified RA genetic polymorphisms were associated with AS in a Taiwanese population. In this study, we enrolled 475 AS patients and 11,301 healthy subjects from a Taiwanese biobank as controls. Although none of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with the susceptibility to AS, the AS disease index Bath AS Global (BAS-G) clinical phenotype was observed as significantly correlated to the AA genotype of rs657075 (CSF2). The significance remains after gender/age/disease duration adjustment and after group categorization by human leukocyte antigen-B 27 (HLA-B27) genotype. We further investigated the possible functions of rs657075 through bioinformatics approaches. Results revealed that polymorphism of rs657075 is able to influence the expression of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 6 (ACSL6). In conclusion, our study indicated that rs657075 (CSF2) is strongly associated with the AS disease index Bath AS Global (BAS-G) clinical phenotype.
5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 Allergic disease; Air pollution; Preconceptional exposure; Pregnancy; Trimester        	Background: Evidence linking prenatal exposure to outdoor air pollution with eczema in early childhood is scare, and the role of components of air pollution and exposure timing remains unclear. Objectives: We investigated the association between exposure to air pollution during preconceptional and perinatal period and the risk of eczema in preschool children. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 2598 children aged 3-6 years in Changsha, China. The prevalence of eczema was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire administered by the parents. Individual exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 10 pm (PM10) during the 4th-6th and 1st-3rd month before pregnancy, entire pregnancy, and three trimesters were estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method based on concentrations measured at monitoring stations. Association between childhood eczema and exposure to air pollution was examined by logistic regression models in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. Results: Life-time prevalence of eczema in preschool children in Changsha was 28.6%. Childhood eczema was associated with traffic-related air pollutant NO2 during 3 months before pregnancy and entire pregnancy with adjusted ORs = 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04-1.37) and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03-1.42) respectively. The highest risk of eczema was observed for the 1st trimester exposure to NO2 [OR = 1.26 (95% CI: 1.09-1.46)]. However, no association was detected for SO2 and Philio exposure during any window. High-level exposure to NO2 during the whole time period significantly increased the effect of NO2 in all windows on eczema risk as compared with low-level exposure. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the association between both preconceptional and perinatal exposure to NO2 and childhood eczema was consistent and robust, and this association was modified by some personal, parental hereditary and indoor environmental factors. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that early childhood eczema is associated with exposure to traffic-related air pollutant during both preconceptional and perinatal period, especially at a high level of exposure.

0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 Ant colony optimization; Dynamic problem; TSPLIB        	Ant colony-based optimization approach is based on stigmergy behavior of natural insects. Ant Colony Optimization shows promising behavior on dynamic problems like Travelling Sales Person (TSP) problems and other TSP like problems. The paper discusses variants of ACO algorithms as well as measures their performance using TspAntSim simulation tool (Aybars U, Dogan A, J Adv Eng 40 (5), 2009 [1]). TSP is NP-Hard problem which shows fluctuant behavior on instances available in the online library TSPLIB. The paper focuses on behavior of ACO algorithm on such problem instances. The basic idea behind this analytical behavioral study is to help the algorithm design the parameter settings as well as problem instance characteristics. The paper concludes with the remarks on algorithm design criteria of any dynamic problem like TSP and its analytical outcome.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Coping with fatherhood; Grounded theory; Struggling with motherhood; Teen parent; Thai teenagers        	Objective: to gain a deeper understanding of Thai teenage parents' perspectives, experiences and reasoning about becoming and being a teenage parent from a gender perspective. Design: an exploratory design using grounded theory methodology. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. An interview guide was developed, a pilot study was undertaken, and interviews were performed on two different occasions: once during the second trimester of pregnancy and again when the infant was 5-6 months old. Setting: a province in the western part of Thailand. Participants: the selection of a heterogeneous group of teenage parents-to-be continued until saturation was reached, as describe by Glaser and Strauss (1967), in all n=50. Inclusion criteria for participants were that they were heterosexual couples, under 20 years of age, cohabiting, and expecting their first child. Findings: the core category 'struggling with motherhood and coping with fatherhood' comprises descriptions of the process from when the teenagers first learned about the pregnancy until the child was six months old. The teenagers had failed to use contraceptives which led to an unintended parenthood. Their parenthood became a turning point as the teenagers started to change their behaviours and lifestyle during pregnancy, and adapted their relationships to partner and family. Family commitments was a facilitator, through support given by their families. Finally, becoming a parent describes ways of dealing with the parental role, by engaging in parental activities and reestablishing goals in life. Most of the teenage parents reproduced traditional gender roles by being a caring mother or a breadwinning father respectively. Key conclusions: 'struggling with motherhood and coping with fatherhood' referred to the parents' stories about how they struggled and coped with life changes and their parental role when they became unintentionally pregnant, accepted their parenting, and finally became parents. After becoming parents, the main concerns of most of the teenage parents were being a caring mother and a breadwinning father. Implications for practice: this study contributes a deeper understanding of Thai teenage parents' experiences of becoming and being a parent and might improve health care professionals' adaptation of care for teentranatanage parents and inspire them to tailor their care specifically to teenager's needs from early pregnancy to parenthood.

3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 Hydrogen storage; Li-Mg-N-H; Amide; Borohydride; Reversibility; Thermal conductivity        	The Li-Mg-N-H system has been widely considered as one of the most promising candidates for on-board hydrogen storage due to its high reversible hydrogen capacity, good reversibility, and favorable thermodynamics. In this study, we show that the hydrogen storage properties of the 2LiNH(2)/MgH2 sample can be further promoted through the addition of Mg(BH4)(2). The onset temperature for the dehydrogenation of the 2LiNH(2)/MgH2/0.1Mg(BH4)(2) sample is only 80 degrees C, showing a reduction of around 50 degrees C with respect to the 2LiNH(2)/MgH2 sample. The hydrogenation tests indicate that the dehydrogenated 2LiNH(2)/MgH2/0.1Mg(BH4)(2) sample could fully absorb about 5.0 wt% of hydrogen at 180 degrees C and 48 bar hydrogen pressure in 2 h, while only 3.5 wt% of hydrogen was recharged into the dehydrogenated 2LiNH(2)/MgH2 sample at 200 degrees C and 48 bar hydrogen pressure even within 30 h. The investigation on the structural changes and the cycling absorption/desortion of hydrogen was also performed. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of the as-milled 2LiNH(2)/MgH2 sample is almost doubled after the addition of 0.1Mg(BH4)(2) without any loss of hydrogen capacity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

1	11	28	ECE 	 Control engineering  	 Wind-sand environment; Wind-sand disaster; Preponderant strong wind flow; Atmospheric boundary layer; Windblown sand damage; Windblown gravel damage        	Based on detailed long-term data of wind regimes collected from typical ventilation sites along the railways in the Gobi area of Xinjiang, this study systematically analyzes the characteristics of the disastrous wind-sand environment along the railways by combining gradient sand sampling data collected by a wind-drift sand monitoring system and site survey data. Wind direction and speed rose diagrams revealed the prevailing wind direction in each wind area along the railways, and this is the wind direction from which the maximum frequency of sandstorms occurred. Drift potential characteristic parameters (RDP, RDD) and the direction variability (RDP/DP) showed that each wind area along the Gobi railway featured a long wind period, with strong power in a single wind direction. The special geological environment of the Gobi determines the wind-drift sand that features gravel of large grain size and unsaturation, which are different from the wind-drift sand in deserts. With increasing wind velocity, the density of the wind-drift sand increased steadily; however, at a certain critical value, the density surged. This study on the wind-sand environment of the Gobi has significance for railway safety. The critical value of wind velocity corresponded to an abrupt increase in the wind-drift sand density and should be taken into account during the planning process of railway safety passage, since this will lead to a decrease in frontal visual distance, and an associated decrease in safety. Additionally, the specific features of wind-drift sand activities, such as the abruptness and higher than usual sand height, should be considered during the process of designing sand-damage-control engineering measures.

Methods A 10-min tilting test and a transthoracic echocardiogram focused on ventricular septal systolic )S wave) and diastolic function )isovolumic relaxation time) were performed. Low frequency on high frequency ratio )LF/HF) and RR variation )variation of beat to beat intervals) in response to passive orthostatism were used as measures of sympathetic reflex activation [delta LF/HF )D-LF/HF) and delta RR )DRR), respectively]. Brain natriuretic peptide was measured. Results A total of 50 HCM patients were categorized in two groups: D-LF/HF more than 0 )group 1, sympathetic response) and D-LF/HF 0 or less )group 2, parasympathetic response). Patients in group 2 had higher New York Heart Association class, a more frequent history of atrial fibrillation )38 versus 9% P=0.04) or syncope )46 versus 12% P=0.01) and an increased septal isovolumic relaxation time )122 versus 82ms P=0.02). The same categorization was made according to lowest quartile DRR )DRR at least 23 ms, group 1: sympathetic response; DRR less than 23 ms, group 2: parasympathetic response). In group 2, patients were older, with advanced New York Heart Association class and higher history of atrial fibrillation. Conclusions Autonomic response to passive orthostatism in HCM appears correlated with specific functional features of the hypertrophic heart. Altered neural afferent traffic from the localized area of segmental hypertrophy resulted in autonomic changes with a blunted sympathetic response, and an inappropriate vagal activation, especially in patients with history of atrial fibrillation or syncope.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 doctoral training; laboratory social environment; mentor-mentee interaction; publication productivity        	We explored the social shaping of science at the microlevel reality of face-to-face interaction in one of the traditional places for scientific activities-the scientific lab. We specifically examined how doctoral students ' perception of their: (i) interaction with doctoral mentors (MMI) and (ii) lab social environment (LSE) influenced productivity. Construed as the production of peer-reviewed articles, we measured productivity using total number of articles (TOTAL), number of articles with impact factor greater than or equal to 4.00 (IFGE4), and number of first-authored articles (NFA). Via face-to-face interviews, we obtained data from n=210 molecular biology Ph. D. students in selected universities in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Additional productivity data (NFA) were obtained from online bibliometric databases. To summarize the original 13 MMI and 13 LSE semantic-differential items which we used to measure students ' perceptions, principal component (PC) analyses were performed. The results were smaller sets of 4 MMI PCs and 4 LSE PCs. To identify which PCs influenced publication counts, we performed Poisson regression analyses. Although perceived MMI was not linked to productivity, perceived LSE was linked: Students who perceived their LSE as intellectually stimulating reported high levels of productivity in both TOTAL and IFGE4, but not in NFA. Our findings not only highlight how students ' perception of their training environment factors in the production of scientific output, our findings also carry important implications for improving mentoring programs in science.

1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Radiation effect; Operational Amplifier; Frequency response; Thermal annealing        	Integrated bipolar Operational Amplifier (op-amp) type A 741 was irradiated with neutrons and gamma rays. The radiation on gain factors, slew rate, and power supply current have been evaluated. The experimental results show a decrease of these parameter values after exposing to the radiation. The advantage of the increase of the voltage power supplies and the thermal annealing treatment on the damaged parameters was also explored. The relationship among different frequency response parameters is also studied leading to an analytical formula for the above degraded parameters.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 Pervious concrete; LEED; permeability; void content; fly ash; recycled aggregate        	Pervious concrete is a special type of concrete with high porosity. The use of pervious concrete may achieve many potential LEED green building rating system credits. The objective of this paper is to investigate the appropriate mix proportion which provides the high LEED points and also the good mechanical properties. Nine mix proportions based on possible LEED points were examined. The replacement of cement by fly ash (20% - 60%) and coarse aggregate by recycled aggregate (20% - 100%) were used. Properties of pervious concrete relating to LEED credits and design values such as permeability, void content, compressive strength and splitting tensile strength were evaluated. It was found that the proposed pervious concrete can achieve the stormwater design-quantity control, recycled content and recycled materials credits. According to the results, the mix proportions which cement was replaced by 40% and 60% of fly ash archived the highest LEED credit points and also provided the sufficient mechanical properties. Therefore, these mix proportions are recommended for green construction.
5	0	72	Medical 	 Addiction  	 Media use; Smartphone; Social media; Adolescents; Latent class analysis; HRQoL        	Purpose: Recent studies linked adolescents' media use to a variety of physical, psychological and social impairments. However, research neglected that adolescents' media use is complex and includes various combinations of activities such as mobile internet browsing, calling, online gaming or use of social network sites. Methods: The aim of this study is to use latent class analysis in a sample 895 Swiss adolescents to classify different media usage types based on eleven media use variables. Subsequently, associations of these classes with health related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire were assessed using multivariable regression models adjusted for relevant confounding factors. Results: Five distinct media use classes could be identified: Low Use, Medium Use, Gaming, Call Preference and High Social Use. The Low Use class reported highest and the High Social Use class lowest HRQoL on the KIDSCREEN scales Moods and Emotions (mean adjusted scores: 55.1 (95%Cl: 53.8; 57.0) vs. 49.1 (47.5; 50.7)), Self-Perception (51.8 (50.3; 53.3) vs. 48.0 (46.7; 49.28), Parents and Home Life (53.3 (51.7; 54.9) vs. 48.6 (47.2; 50.0)) and School Environment (52.7 (51.3; 54.0) vs. 49.3 (48.2; 50.7)). On the subscale Social Support and Peers the pattern was reversed. The Low Use class indicated least and the High Social Use class most well-being (48.5 (47.0; 50.0) vs. 53.8 (52.4; 55.3)). Conclusions: Latent class analyses is a fruitful approach to differentiate between various media usage types and is expected to better characterize and evaluate potential causal associations between media use and HRQoL. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 conjugated linoleic acid; flavoprotein; polyenoic fatty acid isomerase; structure-based mechanism        	Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) affect body fat gain, carcinogenesis, insulin resistance, and lipid peroxidation in mammals. Several isomers of CLA exist, of which the (9Z, 11E) and (10E, 12Z) isomers have beneficial effects on human metabolism but are scarce in foods. Bacterial polyunsaturated fatty acid isomerases are promising biotechnological catalysts for CLA production. We describe six crystal structures of the Propionibacterium acnes polyunsaturated fatty acid isomerase PAI in apo- and product-bound forms. The three-domain flavoprotein has previously undescribed folds outside the FAD-binding site. Conformational changes in a hydrophobic channel toward the active site reveal a unique gating mechanism for substrate specificity. The geometry of the substrate binding site explains the length preferences for C18 fatty acids. A catalytic mechanism for double-bond isomerization is formulated that may be altered to change substrate specificity for syntheses of rare CLAs from easily accessible precursors.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Electron Microscopy (EM); Fluorescence; Kinesin; Kinetics; Microtubules; Eg5; Anisotropy Decay; Cryo-EM; Stopped Flow; Time-resolved Fluorescence        	Background: Loop L5 shapes the enzymology of kinesin motors to meet specific physiologic roles. Results: L5 is in a dynamic equilibrium of three conformations whose relative proportions shift during the ATPase cycle. Conclusion: Interactions between L5 and helix 3 modulate the kinetics of microtubule binding. Significance: Combining transient kinetics with time-resolved fluorescence reveals important insights in the structural dynamics of molecular motors. Members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors differ in several key structural domains, which probably allows these molecular motors to serve the different physiologies required of them. One of the most variable of these is a stem-loop motif referred to as L5. This loop is longest in the mitotic kinesin Eg5, and previous structural studies have shown that it can assume different conformations in different nucleotide states. However, enzymatic domains often consist of a mixture of conformations whose distribution shifts in response to substrate binding or product release, and this information is not available from the static images that structural studies provide. We have addressed this issue in the case of Eg5 by attaching a fluorescent probe to L5 and examining its fluorescence, using both steady state and time-resolved methods. This reveals that L5 assumes an equilibrium mixture of three orientations that differ in their local environment and segmental mobility. Combining these studies with transient state kinetics demonstrates that there is a major shift in this distribution during transitions that interconvert weak and strong microtubule binding states. Finally, in conjunction with previous cryo-EM reconstructions of Eg5microtubule complexes, these fluorescence studies suggest a model in which L5 regulates both nucleotide and microtubule binding through a set of reversible interactions with helix 3. We propose that these features facilitate the production of sustained opposing force by Eg5, which underlies its role in supporting formation of a bipolar spindle in mitosis.
1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 Ito formula; Mielstein scheme; RLC electrical network; stochastic differential equations; stochastic numerical simulations        	The paper deals with vector Ito stochastic integral equations. We replace a parameter in the deterministic model of the RLC electrical circuit with a stochastic one, by adding a noise term to the coefficient and so we introduce the stochastic model of the circuit as a second order stochastic differential equation. By the Ito calculus we solve this equation. For numerical simulations of the stochastic trajectories we present the Euler and the Milstein numerical schemes. We used Matlab for the computations of the stochastic trajectories in the examples.
5	37	109	Medical 	 Myelofibrosis  	 Cutaneous myeloid dendritic cell dyscrasia; Clonal monocytosis; Chronic myeloproliferative disorders; Myeloid dendritic cell        	Monocytes are critical components of the innate immune system and they can differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs). Cutaneous neoplasms of dendritic cell origin are uncommon and mostly represented by histiocytic lesions derived primarily from Langerhans cells. The myeloid DC (mDC) while recognized in the immunology literature does not have a well-defined neoplastic cutaneous counterpart. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous mDC dyscrasia were evaluated. Routine hematoxylin and eosin stain were performed followed by selective phenotypic studies. The patients were older without a gender predilection and exhibited an asymptomatic papular skin rash with a waxing and waning course. The biopsies demonstrated a dermal based monomorphic small mononuclear cell infiltrate. The cells expressed CD14, CD11c, HLA-DR, as well as granzyme and lysozyme that defines terminally differentiated monocyte/dendritic cells. Expression of BDCA-3 (CD141) by the tumor cells indicated that they were myeloid dendritic cells (mDC2). Each patient had a prior or subsequent diagnosis of an abnormal bone marrow biopsy that included myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myelogenous leukemia. We propose the term cutaneous mDC cell dyscrasia for distinctive infiltrates of differentiated mDCs reflective of underlying myeloproliferative disease. The clinical course is variable and can be indolent although it is strongly correlated with myelodysplastic syndrome that included leukemia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 business ethics; business schools; moral background; economic sociology; cultural sociology; sociology of morality        	"Gabriel Abend discusses his interest in the sociology of morality and the main ideas of his book The Moral Background: An Inquiry into the History of Business Ethics [Abend 2014]. According to Abend, the business ethics discipline and its growing popularity at business schools deals not only with the tension between making money and being ethical, but with the preconditions which enable moral life: the moral background. Abend states that studying moralities and moral action in the social sciences is usually viewed through the lens of the first one, behavioral level, and the second one, normative level (moral and immoral behavior and norms, respectively), which, taken together, constitute first-order morality. Abend also points out that the ""moral background"" should be suggested as the third level, or second-order morality, which underlies and supports first-order morality through six dimensions. These include: the reasons for first-level morality support, the existing concepts repertoire, the subject of the moral evaluation, proper moral methods, the objectiveness of morality, and metaphysical conceptions. Some of these dimensions have a society-level organization, such as the conceptual repertoire for speaking about moralities in different languages, and some dimensions have an individual-level organization, such as the objectivity or relativity of first-order morality. Abend identifies two types of moral background that he describes as the ""Christian Merchant"" and the ""Standards of Practice"". The ""Christian Merchant"" type can be characterized as an ethics of being, developing certain features of character and moral objectivism. The ""Standards of Practice"" is an ethics of doing, which sustains moral relativism and emphasizes moral actions with no particular attention to their motives. The ""Standards of Practice"" type has found its way into business schools' curricula as a business ethics discipline that believes morality can be taught by using case studies. This approach, while maintaining the principles of corporate social responsibility, can have negative effects on society and the economy. As long as corporations suggest that ethics pays and act morally only to make a profit, there is a risk that without the payoff, they will stop acting morally. This fact causes questions to surface, not only about corporate social responsibility and ethical behavior in business, but ultimately about values and the place of morality in society at large."
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Principals' transformational leadership; school academic optimism; teachers' academic optimism; teachers' professional commitment        	The main purpose of this research was to examine the relationships among school principals' transformational leadership, school academic optimism, teachers' academic optimism and teachers' professional commitment. This study conducted a questionnaire survey on 367 teachers from 20 high schools in Taiwan by random sampling, using principals' transformational leadership scale, a school academic optimism scale, teachers' academic optimism scale, and teachers' professional commitment scale. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that there is good fit in the factor structure of school academic optimism and teachers' academic optimism. The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation analysis and path analysis revealed that principals' transformational leadership has a positive effect on school academic optimism and teachers' academic optimism. School academic optimism has a positive effect on teachers' academic optimism. Principals' transformational leadership and teachers' academic optimism have a positive effect on teachers' professional commitment. Finally, this research offers some suggestions based on the results.
5	41	113	Medical 	 Overactive Bladder  	 lower urinary tract symptoms; quantitative trait; heritable; twins        	Purpose: Symptoms of urinary irritation, urgency, frequency and obstruction, known as lower urinary tract symptoms, are common in urological practice. However, little is known about the etiology or pathogenesis of lower urinary tract symptoms, especially the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the development of these symptoms. We used a classic twin study design to examine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms in middle-aged men. Materials and Methods: Twins were members of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. We used a mail survey to collect data on lower urinary tract symptoms using the I-PSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) instrument. Twin correlations and biometric modeling were used to determine the relative genetic and environmental contributions to variance in I-PSS total score and individual items. Results: Participants were 1,002 monozygotic and 580 dizygotic middle-aged male twin pairs (mean age 50.2 years, SD 3.0). Nearly 25% of the sample had an I-PSS greater than 8, indicating at least moderate lower urinary tract symptoms. The heritability of the total I-PSS was 37% (95% CI 32-42). Heritability estimates ranged from 21% for nocturia to 40% for straining, with moderate heritability (34% to 36%) for urinary frequency and urgency. Conclusions: Genetic factors provide a moderate contribution (20% to 40%) to lower urinary tract symptoms in middle-aged men, suggesting that environmental factors may also contribute substantially to lower urinary tract symptoms. Future research is needed to define specific genetic and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of these symptoms and conditions associated with lower urinary tract symptoms.
5	9	81	Medical 	 Skin Care  	 cosmetic products; emollients; home care nursing service; moisturizers; nurse; nursing; prevalence; skin care; skin integrity        	Aims. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequencies and patterns of skin care and applied skin care products in the home care nursing setting in Germany. Background. Skin care belongs to the core activities of nursing practice. Especially in aged and long-term care settings, clients are vulnerable to various skin conditions. Dry skin is one of the most prevalent problems. Using mild skin cleansers and the regular application of moisturizing leave-on products is recommended. Until today, there are no quantitative empirical data about nursing skin care practice at home in the community. Design. A multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2012. Methods. Home care clients from the German home care nursing setting were randomly selected. Instructed nurse raters performed the data collection using standardized forms. Variables included demographics, skin care needs and skin caring activities. Results. Approximately 60% of home care clients received skin care interventions. The majority were washed and two-thirds received a leave-on product once daily. There was large heterogeneity in cleansing and skin care product use. Most often the product labels were unknown or product types were selected haphazardly. Conclusion. Skin care interventions play a significant role in home care and nurses have a considerable responsibility for skin health. Skin care provided does not meet recent recommendations. The importance of targeted skin cleansing and care might be underestimated. There are a confusing variety of skin care products available and often the labels provide little information regarding the ingredients or guidance about how they affect skin health.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 cancer; financial toxicity; geographic disparity; socioeconomic disparities; telehealth        	Cancer care continues to stress the US healthcare system with increases in life expectancy, cancer prevalence, and survivors' complex needs. These challenges are compounded by socioeconomic, racial, and cultural disparities that are associated with poor clinical outcomes. One innovative and resource-wise strategy to address this demand on the system is expanded use of telehealth. This paradigm has the potential to decrease healthcare and patient out-of-pocket costs and improve patient adherence to recommended treatment and/or surveillance.
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 Bariatric surgery; prospective predictors; psychosocial predictors; systematic review        	This is the first systematic review to synthesize the evidence concerning early postoperative variables predictive of later weight and psychosocial outcomes in bariatric surgery. Eight electronic databases for empirical studies were searched ( 1954 to 2016). Most of the 39 included studies reported solely on weight outcomes; eating and psychosocial outcomes were less common. A better early weight loss trajectory was the most consistent predictor of more successful medium-term weight outcome (<= 24 months); however, its relationship to longer term weight loss maintenance is less certain. Early eating adaptation may be associated with later weight loss, but further research is needed. Evidence is lacking for associations between early adherence or early psychosocial variables and later outcome. In particular, the relationship between early post-operative depression and later weight remains unclear. Little research has considered early prediction of later eating or psychosocial outcomes. Consideration of mediating or moderating relationships is lacking. The body of evidence is limited, and synthesis is hampered by heterogeneity in the type and time at which predictors and outcomes are measured and quality of statistical reporting. Further research on prospective prediction of bariatric surgery outcome is needed to guide early post-operative intervention for those at greatest risk of poor outcomes.
1	13	30	ECE 	 State space representation  	 Piezoelectric Actuation; Positive Position Feedback; Vibration Suppression; Modal Analysis; Subspace Identification Method        	This work addresses the solution to the problem of active vibration suppression of a cantilever beam using piezoelectric actuation. For this purpose, we are taking advantage of the effectiveness of the positive position feedback control strategy (PPF) in order to control first mode vibrations of the analyzed beam. This control technique is well-known in the literature as a modal control method for vibration attenuation. The PPF controller accomplishes its best performance if tuned properly to the characteristics of the structure to be controlled. According to this we are going to realize the modal analysis of the cantilever beam utilizing the finite element method in Ansys to determine the structural frequency corresponding to the first mode, which is used as PPF controller frequency. On the other hand, we shall obtain the state-space representation of the cantilever beam using the subspace identification method in frequency domain applying the fast fourier transformation (FFT). Furthermore, we will simulate the discrete-time PPF controller using Matlab/Simulink. Lastly, the simulink designed discrete-time PPF controller will be tested using an xPC Target real-time system.

2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 psychopathy; psychopathic traits; personality traits; individual differences; reinforcement learning; social learning; associative learning; computational modeling        	Psychopathy is often linked to disturbed reinforcement-guided adaptation of behavior in both clinical and non-clinical populations. Recent work suggests that these disturbances might be due to a deficit in actively using information to guide changes in behavior. However, how much information is actually used to guide behavior is difficult to observe directly. Therefore, we used a computational model to estimate the use of information during learning. Thirty-six female subjects were recruited based on their total scores on the Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI), a self-report psychopathy list, and performed a task involving simultaneous learning of reward-based and social information. A Bayesian reinforcement-learning model was used to parameterize the use of each source of information during learning. Subsequently, we used the subscales of the PPI to assess psychopathy-related traits, and the traits that were strongly related to the model's parameters were isolated through a formal variable selection procedure. Finally, we assessed how these covaried with model parameters. We succeeded in isolating key personality traits believed to be relevant for psychopathy that can be related to model-based descriptions of subject behavior. Use of reward-history information was negatively related to levels of trait anxiety and fearlessness, whereas use of social advice decreased as the perceived ability to manipulate others and lack of anxiety increased. These results corroborate previous findings suggesting that sub-optimal use of different types of information might be implicated in psychopathy. They also further highlight the importance of considering the potential of computational modeling to understand the role of latent variables, such as the weight people give to various sources of information during goal-directed behavior, when conducting research on psychopathy-related traits and in the field of forensic psychiatry.
2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 cultural techniques; media; media violence; mediation; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychiatry; television; trauma        	Recent studies in psychiatry reveal an acceptance of trauma through the media. Traditionally restricted to immediate experience, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is now expanding to include mediated experience. How did this development come about? How does mediated trauma manifest itself? What are its consequences? This essay addresses these questions through three cases: (1) trauma film paradigm', an early 1960s research program that employed films to simulate traumatic effects; (2) the psychiatric study into the clinical effects of watching catastrophic events on television, culminating with the September 11 attacks; (3) reports on drone operators who exhibit PTSD symptoms after flying combat missions away from the war zone. The recognition of mediated trauma marks a qualitative change in the understanding of media effects, rendering the impact literal and the consequences clinical. What informs recent speculations about the possibility of trauma through media is a conceptual link between visual media and contemporary conceptions of trauma.
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 sexist humor; Facebook; social media; person perception        	Despite advances in women's equality, and perhaps as a result of it, sexist humor is prevalent in society. Research on this topic has lacked realism in the way the humor is conveyed to participants, and has not examined perceptions of both men and women who use sexist humor. We embedded jokes in printed Facebook profiles to present sexist humor to participants. We manipulated the gender of the individual in the profile (man or woman), and the type of joke presented (anti-men, anti-women, neutral) in a 2 x 3 between-groups design. We found that both men and women rated anti-women jokes as more sexist than neutral humor, and women also rated anti-men jokes as sexist. We also found that men who displayed anti-women humor were perceived less positively than men displaying anti-men humor, or women displaying either type of humor. These findings suggest that there may be different gender norms in place for joke tellers regarding who is an acceptable target of sexist humor.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Aging; Historic samples; Molecular archaeology; NMR; Oligosaccharides        	The 19th century witnessed many advances in scientific enzymology and microbiology that laid the foundations for modern biotechnological industries. In the current study, we analyze the content of original lager beer samples from the 1880s, 1890s and 1900s with emphasis on the carbohydrate content and composition. The historic samples include the oldest samples brewed with pure Saccharomyces carlsbergensis yeast strains. While no detailed record of beer pasteurization at the time is available, historic samples indicate a gradual improvement of bottled beer handling from the 1880s to the 1900s, with decreasing contamination by enzymatic and microbial activities over this time span. Samples are sufficiently well preserved to allow comparisons to present-day references, thus yielding molecular signatures of the effects of 20th century science on beer production. Opposite to rather stable carbohydrate profiles, some aldehydes reach up to 40-fold higher levels in the historic samples as compared to present-day references. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

0	11	11	CS 	 Structured Storage  	 data placement; energy conservation; response time; RAID        	Many real-world applications like Video-On-Demand (VOD) and Web servers require prompt responses to access requests. However, with an explosive increase of data volume and the emerging of faster disks with higher power requirements, energy consumption of disk based storage systems has become a salient issue. To achieve energy-conservation and prompt responses simultaneously, in this paper we propose a novel energy-saving data placement strategy, called Striping-based Energy-Aware (SEA), which can be applied to RAID-structured storage systems to noticeably save energy while providing quick responses. Further, we implement two SEA-powered RAID-based data placement algorithms, SEA0 and SEA5, by incorporating the SEA strategy into RAID-0 and RAID-5, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with three well-known data placement algorithms Greedy, SP, and HP, SEA0 and SEA5 reduce mean response time on average at least 52.15% and 48.04% while saving energy on average no less than 10.12% and 9.35%, respectively.
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 geotextile-reinforced soil walls; model walls; frost heave; depth of frost penetration; control of deformations        	Cases have been reported of deformed geotextile-reinforced soil walls in cold regions. The deformation is likely to be caused by frost heavein the backfill soil of reinforced soil walls. To prevent the deformation caused by frost heave, the Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has established specific construction techniques. However, no preventive measures have been specified for geotextile-reinforced soil wallsalready in service. Toward proposing countermeasures to frost-heave deformation, full-scale tests were conducted. The results demonstrated that application of insulating materials to the outer surface of geotextile-reinforced soil walls helps to control frostheave deformation.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 bile acid; elicitor; Erwinia amylovora; plant defence; Pseudomonas syringae; SID2; WAK        	Disease has an effect on crop yields, causing significant losses. As the worldwide demand for agricultural products increases, there is a need to pursue the development of new methods to protect crops from disease. One mechanism of plant protection is through the activation of the plant immune system. By exogenous application, 'plant activator molecules' with elicitor properties can be used to activate the plant immune system. These defence-inducing molecules represent a powerful and often environmentally friendly tool to fight pathogens. We show that the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) induces defence in Arabidopsis and reduces the proliferation of two bacterial phytopathogens: Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We describe the global defence response triggered by this new plant activator in Arabidopsis at the transcriptional level. Several induced genes were selected for further analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We describe the kinetics of their induction and show that abiotic stress, such as moderate drought or nitrogen limitation, does not impede DCA induction of defence. Finally, we investigate the role in the activation of defence by this bile acid of the salicylic acid biosynthesis gene SID2, of the receptor-like kinase family genes WAK1-3 and of the NADPH oxidase-encoding RbohD gene. Altogether, we show that DCA constitutes a promising molecule for plant protection which can induce complementary lines of defence, such as callose deposition, reactive oxygen species accumulation and the jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling pathways.
3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 Deleuze; intensity; thermodynamics; entropy; virtual; actual        	Deleuze's use of thermodynamics in the fifth chapter of his masterwork Difference and Repetition ushers in perhaps the most crucial notion for understanding this work: intensity. Given that the process of actualisation relies on the intensive necessarily means that any discussion of the relationship between the virtual and the actual must include a thorough explanation of the role of intensity, and where exactly this notion sits within the virtual-actual doublet. As such, we must return to the fifth chapter of Difference and Repetition in order to assess the way in which Deleuze conceives of this complex and indispensable cog in his ontological and metaphysical philosophy. In this paper we turn, then, to Deleuze's engagement with the theories of the intensive as found in classical thermodynamic theory. Quite simply, Deleuze will highlight the way in which the productive force of differences in intensity remains under-appreciated in contrast to the extensive states they create in this classical framework. We can understand this engagement, then, as an example of the way in which the extensive is continually privileged over the intensive. In this paper we will outline the details of the engagement between Deleuze and thermodynamics, as this paves the way for his own philosophy of intensity. Furthermore, we will provide a theory of the relationship between intensity, the virtual and the actual as these notions appear in Difference and Repetition
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Arduino; evoked potentials; glaucoma; pattern electroretinogram; PERG; retinal ganglion cell        	Recording evoked potentials in un-anesthetized animals and people is a powerful technique to non-invasively measure the function of neurons. As such, the primary output neurons of the eye can be assessed by the pattern electroretinogram (PERG). Currently, electro-physiologic setups to perform PERG or related recordings are costly, complicated, and non-portable. Here, we design a simple steady-state PERG system, based off an Arduino board. The amplifier is built on a shield that fits over a microcontroller board, an Arduino, which digitizes the signal and sends it to a computer that presents stimuli then records and analyzes the evoked potentials. We used the device to record PERG accurately with a sensitivity as low as half a microvolt. The device has also been designed to implement other evoked potential recordings. This simple device can be quickly constructed and used for experiments in moving systems. Additionally, this device can be used to expose students in underserved areas to research technology that they would otherwise not have access to.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Detergents; proteases; bovine serum albumin degradation capacity; teaching protein chemistry and industrial biochemistry; industrial enzymology        	Detergent enzymes account for about 30% of the total worldwide production of enzymes and are one of the largest and most successful applications of modern industrial biotechnology. Proteases can improve the wash performance of household, industrial, and institutional laundry detergents used to remove protein-based stains such as blood, grass, body fluids, and food soils. This article describes two easy and cheap laboratory exercises to study the presence, profile, and basic enzymology of detergent proteases. These laboratory practicals are based on the determination of the detergent protease activity of various commercial detergents using the N-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide method and the bovine serum albumin degradation capacity. Students are also required to elucidate the enzymatic subtype of detergent proteases by studying the inhibitory potential of several types of protease inhibitors revealed by the same experimental methodology. Additionally, the results of the exercises can be used to provide additional insights on elementary enzymology by studying the influence of several important parameters on protease activity such as temperature (in this article) and the influence of pH and effects of surfactants and oxidizers (proposed). Students also develop laboratory skills, problem-solving capacities, and the ability to write a laboratory report. The exercises are mainly designed for an advanced undergraduate project in the biochemistry and biotechnology sciences. Globally, these laboratory practicals show students the biotechnological applications of proteases in the detergent industry and also reinforce important enzymology concepts.
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 intelligent morphing; self-adaptive control; nose deflection; dynamics characteristics        	Deflection nose is a new concept of fast response control mode, partial nose of projectile can deflect certain angle relative to the axis of projectile body and pressure difference emerges in the windward and leeward side of warhead then generates aerodynamic control force, and this control way has high control efficiency and very good application prospect in the ammunition system. Nose deflection actuator based on smart material and structure makes projectile body morphing then obtains additional aerodynamic force and moment, changes the aerodynamic characteristics in the projectile flight process, produces the corresponding balance angle, sideslip angle then resulting in motor overload, adjusts flight moving posture and controls the ballistics, finally realizes shooting range changing and improves firing accuracy. In order to study characteristics of self-adaptive control projectile, numerical simulations were conducted by fluid dynamics software ANSYS FLUENT for fin stabilized rocket projectile. Computed aerodynamics on different nose delectation angle, different Mach number and different angle of attack, and compared the aerodynamic characteristics with the different nose deflection angles. Results show that the nose deflection control has bigger influence on the head of rocket projectile, and caused asymmetry of the flow field structure, make the warhead differential pressure in the windward and leeward surface increases, resulting in a larger lift. Finally, ballistics experiments were done for verification. Results can offer theoretical basis for self-adaptive rocket projectile design and optimization also provides new ideas and methods for field smart ammunition research.
0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 Functional dependency; Error estimation; Distributed processing        	Measuring or estimating the number of errors in (i.e., violations to) a functional dependency (FD) offers valuable information about data semantics and quality. Most existing work focuses on FD error estimation in a centralized environment, where data are stored only in one site and the goal is to optimize the time and space complexities of the estimation algorithms. The distributed FD error estimation problem, in which the data can reside in multiple physically distributed sites, has never been studied in depth and is the subject of this work. In this work, we study a version of the distributed FD error estimation problem where a coordinator site communicates with multiple remote sites for arriving at such estimations, and the goal is to minimize this communication cost. We study two types of queries-that are dual to each other in semantics-for such estimations: one tries to maximize the accuracies of FD error estimations under fixed communication costs, and the other to minimize the communication costs needed to meet certain accuracy requirements. In our framework, each remote site maintains a concise synopsis data structure obtained by scanning its local data once, and the coordinator site receives and processes all such data structures to arrive at an estimate of the FD error. Our solution extends from the case of two remote sites to that of multiple remote sites. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques via rigorous analysis and extensive experiments.

1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 Harmonics; Energy Quality; Lighting        	With the Brazilian market to international industrial products, it is necessary to check the quality conformity of these products in order to protect the consumer, encouraging continuous quality improvement and promote competition between manufactures [1]. The Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL's or LFC's) are one of the several products that the National Institute of metrology, quality and technology (INMETRO) regulates the quality. One of the LFC's testing stages is to keep the LFC's supplied with electric power for a time period and after this period switch off the LFC's in according to a predefined schedule. The construction of the LFC's supplied circuit is done using semiconductors, and these electronics components can cause an undesirable effect (harmonics) in electrical network. These effects cause a variety of problems in driving, conduction and stabilization laboratory circuits. This paper presents an analysis and suggests a solution to the problem of energy quality in one of the laboratories accredited by INMETRO.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Microbiota; Microbiome; Multiple sclerosis; Experimental autoimmune; encephalomyelitis; Immunology; Autoimmunity        	Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease that affects young adults; in that age group, it represents the second leading cause of disability in our setting. Its precise aetiology has not been elucidated, but it is widely accepted to occur in genetically predisposed patients who are exposed to certain environmental factors. The discovery of the regulatory role played by intestinal microbiota in various autoimmune diseases has opened a new line of research in this field, which is discussed in this review. Development: We reviewed published studies on the role of the microbiota in the development of both MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In mice, it has been shown that intestinal microorganisms regulate the polarisation of T helper cells from Th1-Th17 up to Th2, the function of regulatory T cells, and the activity of B cells; they participate in the pathogenesis of EAE and contribute to its prevention and treatment. In contrast, evidence in humans is still scarce and mainly based on case-control studies that point to the presence of differences in certain bacterial communities. Conclusions: Multiple evidence points to the rote of microbiota in EAE. Extrapolation of these results to MS is still in the early stages of research, and studies are needed to define which bacterial populations are associated with MS, the role they play in pathogenesis, and the therapeutic possibilities this knowledge offers us.

3	7	59	MAE 	 Materials Engineering  	 Battery; Energy Density; Power; Cathode        	Considerations of energy density, power, and calendar life are critical to effectively develop advanced secondary systems. For next generation battery applications requiring multiple features including long life, large cycle count, high energy density and high power, new strategies are needed for the rational design of electroactive materials and electrodes. This article discusses several conceptual approaches under exploration with examples from our research group. The first approach is the systematic synthesis of materials with structures facilitating ion insertion and deinsertion at high voltage and energy density, where we control materials properties such as surface area, particle size and in particular crystallite size. A second approach is the investigation of novel electrode structures and substrates to increase energy density and capacity retention under cycling, where we have developed strategies for minimizing passive components. A third approach is investigation of catalysts for metal air batteries where the cathode active material is drawn from the air rather than carried in the battery.

This paper undertakes a comparative case analysis to examine efforts in combating river pollution in two major rivers - the Yangtze in China and the Ganga in India. Our analysis suggests that efforts in combating river pollution in the two Asian giants have encountered substantial challenges, such as the lack of comprehensive legal mechanisms to control pollution at the basin level, the lack of coordination among multiple government agencies, and significant gaps in policy implementation. Our analysis also points out considerable differences between China and India in institutional structure, regulatory approaches and policy instruments in dealing with river pollution.

1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 Clinching joint; Position tracking; RBF neural network; Servo press; Sliding mode control        	This paper focuses on the quality improvements on clinching joints using a servo press with a Radial basis function neural network and a sliding mode (RBFS) control strategy. Bottom thickness, which is affected by the press punch position, is usually used to monitor clinching joint quality. Traditional clinching presses are driven by pneumatic pistons or motors that provide feedback on punch force or motor position. However, this feedback is indirectly related to the joint bottom thickness. Clinching workers who set the control parameters on these presses depend on tests and statistics. Thus, this paper presents a servo press system that utilizes punch position feedback to directly control the joint bottom thickness. Transmission errors are considered for the movement accuracy of the servo press. A mathematical model of the servo press is established for analyzing. An algorithm, which combines RBF neural network and sliding mode, is proposed and applied for press position tracking. This algorithm adopts an RBF neural network to approximate the nominal model of the press system. The update law of the algorithm is based on the Lyapunov function used to prove the stability of a closed-loop system. The sliding mode controller compensates for the neural network error and disturbance. Finally, experiments are executed on the servo press with an RBFS controller. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a fuzzy PID controller is also applied to the press for comparison. The results indicate that the servo clinching press system with RBFS efficiently and accurately control the clinching jointing process.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 DNA replication; helicase; nucleic acid enzymology; protein-protein interaction; cell        	CDC45, which plays a role in eukaryotic DNA replication, is a member of the CMG (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) complex that is thought to function as a replicative DNA helicase. However, the biochemical properties of CDC45 are not fully understood. We systematically examined the interactions of human CDC45 with MCM2-7, GINS and other replication proteins by immunoprecipitation. We found that CDC45 can directly interact with all MCM2-7 proteins; with PSF2, PSF3 and SLD5 in GINS subunits; and with replication protein A2 (RPA2), AND-1 and topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1. These results are consistent with the notion that CDC45 plays a role in progression of DNA replication forks. Experiments using antibodies against CDC45 show that the level of CDC45 recovered from the Triton-insoluble chromatin-containing fraction is peaked at middle of S phase in synchronized HeLa cells. However, incubation of the Triton-insoluble fraction with nucleases resulted in recovery of less than half the amount of CDC45 in the nuclease-sensitive fraction; this result is in contrast with RPA1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen distribution. These results indicate that a considerable portion of CDC45 localizes in a region other than the DNA replication forks in nuclei or it localizes on the replication forks but it is not fractionated with the fork proteins owing to its tight association with presumably nuclear scaffolds.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 humor styles; self-enhancing humor; state anxiety        	We conducted three experiments to determine if engaging in self-enhancing humor can alleviate state anxiety associated with an anticipated stressful event. In all three experiments, participants imagined they were about to take a stressful math test. In Experiment 1 participants who engaged in self-enhancing humor while anticipating taking the test experienced less state anxiety than those who engaged in self-defeating humor or no humor at all. Experiment 2 demonstrated that engaging in self-enhancing humor reduced state anxiety more than mere instructions to adopt a non-serious, humorous outlook in the stressful situation. Experiment 3 revealed that self-enhancing humor alone induced participants to adopt a humorous perspective on the stressful math test, but that participants responded with the least state anxiety when they were also given instructions about how to use the humor to reframe the math test. Collectively, our findings corroborate and extend previous correlational studies showing that self-enhancing humor can alleviate state anxiety associated with a stressful event.
3	8	60	MAE 	 Strength of materials  	 retrofitting; old reinforced concrete building; anchorage of CFRP sheets; improvement of flexural behaviour        	The earthquake behaviour of a four-storey reinforced concrete (R/C) building, which was constructed in 1933, is investigated here, before and after a recent maintenance and retrofitting. The numerically predicted earthquake behaviour of the initial structure, under the provisions of the current Greek Seismic Code, demonstrated the low resistance of this building to the design seismic loads. The estimate of the strength of existing structural members was based on specific tests performed in-situ as well as at the Laboratory of Strength of Materials and Structures, Aristotle University. The retrofitting scheme included the strengthening of vertical structural elements by jacketing, as well as the use of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) for the improvement of the bearing capacity of the slabs. The numerically predicted earthquake behaviour of the retrofitted structure demonstrated the sufficient resistance of the retrofitted building.
1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 Fuel cells; Hybrid powertrain; Magnetic flywheel; Multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (MANFIS); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller        	Because hydrogen can be extracted naturally and stored for a long time, different types of fuel cells have been developed to generate clean power, particularly for use in vehicles. However, the power demand of a running vehicle leads to unstable and irregular loading of fuel cells. This not only reduces fuel cell lifespan and efficiency but also affects driving safety when the slow output response cannot satisfy an abrupt increase in power demand. Magnetic flywheels with characteristics such as high energy density, high-speed charging ability, and low loss have been extensively used in Formula One cars. This study developed a hybrid powertrain in which a magnetic flywheel system (MFS) is integrated with the fuel cells to solve the aforementioned problems. Moreover, an auto-tuning proportional integral derivative (PID) controller based on the controls of a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system and particle swarm optimization was designed for MFS control. Furthermore, MATLAB/Simulink simulations considering an FTP-75 urban driving cycle were conducted, and a variability improvement of approximately 273% in fuel cell output was achieved.

1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 Biquadratic universal filter; voltage-mode circuit; operational transconductance amplifier; analog signal processing        	This paper presents a new electronically tunable versatile voltage-mode biquadratic filter with three inputs and three outputs using four operational transconductance amplifiers, one current conveyor and two grounded capacitors. The proposed circuit can realize second-order low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-stop and all-pass filters by appropriately connecting the input and output terminals. The natural frequency and the quality factor can be set orthogonally by the circuit components. Also the natural frequency can be electronically controlled. For realizing all the filter responses, no component-matching conditions are required. The active and passive sensitivities are low and the input-impedances are high. PSPICE simulation results are given to confirm the presented theory.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 adolescence; drug use; prosocial behaviour; problem solving        	The objectives of the present study are the following ones: 1) to study the use of drugs, the prosocial behaviour and the problem-solving skills with respect to age and gender, and 2) to analyze the association of both the prosocial behaviour and the problem-solving skills with the use of drugs. An descriptive cross-sectional study was performed, amongst a sample of 567 students in Spanish Compulsory Secondary Education (48.14% males) with an age range from 14 to 17 years (M = 14.92; SD = .90). Statistically significant differences were found concerning alcohol use and the prosocial behaviour with respect to gender, as well as concerning alcohol and cannabis use with respect to age. When we controlled the effect of age and sex in the regression models, the variable that best predicted alcohol and cannabis use was prosocial behavior. The results from this study enhance the importance of tailored interventions based on the promotion of prosocial behaviours as fundamental protective factor for substances use such as alcohol and cannabis amongst adolescents.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Contraception; Birth control; Selection or choice; IUD; Mental health; Depressive symptoms        	Objective: We examine the association between depressive symptoms and contraceptive method choice among adolescents initiating prescription contraception. Study design: This cross-sectional study analyzes baseline data of 220 urban, minority adolescent females (ages 15-19 years) presenting for prescription contraceptive initiation at a comprehensive, free-of-cost, adolescent health center in New York City. All participants met with a health care provider who provided standard contraception counseling before initiating contraception. Each participant then selected a short- or long-acting contraceptive: a 3-month supply of the pill, patch, ring or a medroxyprogesterone acetate depot injection (short-acting), or placement/referral for an intrauterine device (RID; long-acting). We assess the independent association between contraceptive method selection and symptoms of depression [assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale]. Results: Ten percent (n=21/220) of adolescent females selected an IUD. Bivariate analysis revealed that those with elevated levels of depressive symptoms were more likely to select an IUD as compared to those with minimal symptoms (mean CES-D score 20 vs. 13; t=3.052, p=.003). In multivariate logistic regressions, adolescent females had increased odds of selecting an IUD if they reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio=4.93; confidence interval, 1.53-15.83; p=.007) after controlling for ethnicity/race, education, number of lifetime partners and gravidity. Conclusions: Inner-city, minority adolescents with elevated symptoms of depression who present for prescription contraceptive initiation may be more likely to select an IUD rather than shorter-acting methods. By recognizing adolescent females with depressive symptoms, providers can strategize their approach to effective contraception counseling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 Educational paths; employability skills; engineering; graduate attributes; perceptions        	This study aimed to provide insights on the perceptions of engineering students from two educational paths in Singapore of desired graduate attributes by employers. Research questions: (1) Do graduates from the polytechnic and junior college paths have similar perceptions with regard to the ranking of desirable graduate attributes? (2) If not, in what ways are their perceptions different? Literature review: A review of literature on employers' ranking of desirable graduate attributes revealed mismatches in employers' and graduates' rankings. There has not been any published study on student awareness of employability skills in Singapore in particular. Hence, this study investigated the perceptions of final-year engineering students from two different educational paths of their ranking of graduate attributes. Methodology: The students were asked to rank eight attributes and explain their ranking from an employer's perspective. Results: The findings show that communication, teamwork, and problem-solving were ranked the top three desirable attributes by both groups of students. However, polytechnic students seem to reflect greater familiarity and confidence in tackling workplace requirements compared to junior college students. The implications of the findings are presented.
0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Combination; Connection; Manager Component; Software Components; Viewpoint        	The interest behind the use of component based software engineering is to divide an information system in subsystems with less complexity, the reduction of time, faster development, and enhancing the productivity. The software systems are developed by assembling components which are software units that offer a set of services exposed as interfaces. The indispensable role of component-based development is the component model that defines how components can be built and how they can be assembled. A component is intended to provide specific services as the management of the combination and the communication between the system units. The Manager Component is an important and complementary paradigm for the development of software systems. The functionalities that it encapsulates must be related and consistent. The model presented in this paper proposes a component called Manager Software component based on the viewpoint (vision of each system user and actor) by the assembly of Base Component and system components.
1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 Flipped voltage follower; DTMOS; low voltage analog signal processing; Triple well CMOS process; low power        	In the past body terminal was considered as an exclusive source of unwanted second order effects. But recently use of body terminal is becoming an attractive opportunity for improving the performance of analog integrated circuits. Low frequency harmonic distortion stems from the body effect and is dependent on body effect coefficient. In most of the analysis, body effect present in conventional flipped voltage follower (FVF) has been neglected however in submicron low voltage circuits it cannot be neglected. In this paper, we propose to utilize body effect positively using dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) transistor. The proposed FVF exhibits linear behaviour for large excursions of the output voltage and linear range has increased by +/- 20 mV. There is an improvement in the slew-rate(SR) performance and SR has become more symmetrical in proposed FVF. The proposed FVF is mapped on to the TSMC 250nm CMOS technology. Simulations at low supply voltage of 1.3V validate the proposed FVF. The proposed FVF is expected to be useful in low voltage high speed analog signal processing applications.
2	10	43	Psychology  	 Schizophrenia  	 Schizophrenia; vocational rehabilitation; global functioning; self-esteem; employment outcome        	Background: Employment is an important part of recovery for individuals with schizophrenia. The employment rate for this group is as low as 10% in Norway, and major system related barriers to employment are evident.Aims: This study reports the competitive employment outcome at 2-year follow-up of a vocational rehabilitation study augmented with cognitive remediation (CR) or elements from cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It also investigates if global functioning, self-esteem, and depression at baseline predicts employment outcome, and if change in these variables during the intervention period is associated with employment outcome.Method: One hundred and forty-eight participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in six Norwegian counties received 10 months vocational rehabilitation augmented with either CBT (n=84) or CR (n=64). Both competitive and sheltered workplaces were used. Participants were assessed at baseline, at the end of the intervention period, and at 2-year follow-up.Results: At 2-year follow-up, 21.2% had obtained competitive employment. A further 25.3% had work placements in competitive workplaces. Significant improvements were found in global functioning, self-esteem, and depression during the intervention period, but no significant differences between the two intervention groups. High baseline global functioning and self-esteem, as well as positive change in these variables during the intervention period, were significantly associated with higher competitive employment outcome at 2-year follow-up.Conclusion: The results add to existing evidence that competitive employment is attainable for individuals with schizophrenia. High global functioning and self-esteem were strongly associated with competitive employment outcome.
1	12	29	ECE 	 Signal-flow graph  	 small-signal analysis; signal-flow-graph; transient response; buck-boost; inverters        	The newly proposed Z-Source inverter has been proven in the literature to exhibit both steady-state voltage buck and boost capabilities using a unique LC impedance network coupled between the power source and converter circuit. This paper now presents transient modeling and analysis of a voltage-type Z-source inverter. These aspects are found to be challenging and they need to be carefully investigated before attempting to design advanced control algorithms for controlling the Z-source inverter. Through detailed analysis, the paper identifies several phenomena on the dc and ac-sides of the inverter, which would result in the inverter having an inferior non-minimum-phase transient response. The dc-side phenomenon is associated with the Z-source impedance network which is shown through small-signal and signal-flow-graph analyses to be having a right-half-plane zero in its control-to-output transfer function. Also, the ac-side phenomenon is shown through space vector analysis to depend on the time intervals of inverter states used for reconstructing the desired inverter output voltage. Based on the ac vectorial analysis, a method for improving the inverter transient response is also presented. Lastly, simulation results obtained using a switching-functional model and experimental results obtained using a laboratory prototype are presented for validating the described theoretical concepts.

And it requires lots of other parts and some labor for assembly. Recently a molding technology is increasingly applied to embed simple circuits on a plastic casing. The technology is called as MID(Molded Interconnected Device). By using this technology PCB fabrication can be replaced by molding, and lot of the corresponding assembly process for the PCB can be eliminated when if the circuit is simple enough to molding. Furthermore as the improvement of conductive materials and printing technologies of electric circuit, simple circuits can be printed directly on the part casing. It reduces the complexity of the product design and production cost also. Therefore this paper introduces a new MID fabrication process by using direct 3D printing technology. And applied to an automotive part of cruise control switch. The methodology and design is shown.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Event-based cameras; visual odometry; SLAM; simulation        	New vision sensors, such as the dynamic and active-pixel vision sensor (DAVIS), incorporate a conventional global-shutter camera and an event-based sensor in the same pixel array. These sensors have great potential for high-speed robotics and computer vision because they allow us to combine the benefits of conventional cameras with those of event-based sensors: low latency, high temporal resolution, and very high dynamic range. However, new algorithms are required to exploit the sensor characteristics and cope with its unconventional output, which consists of a stream of asynchronous brightness changes (called events) and synchronous grayscale frames. For this purpose, we present and release a collection of datasets captured with a DAVIS in a variety of synthetic and real environments, which we hope will motivate research on new algorithms for high-speed and high-dynamic-range robotics and computer-vision applications. In addition to global-shutter intensity images and asynchronous events, we provide inertial measurements and ground-truth camera poses from a motion-capture system. The latter allows comparing the pose accuracy of ego-motion estimation algorithms quantitatively. All the data are released both as standard text files and binary files (i.e. rosbag). This paper provides an overview of the available data and describes a simulator that we release open-source to create synthetic event-camera data.
5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 anterior subcapsular cataract (ASC); atopic dermatitis; myofibroblast; transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta); epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)        	Purpose. To report the histopathological features of anterior subcapsular cataract associated with atopic dermatitis. Case Report. A 29-year-old man with atopic dermatitis presented with bilateral anterior subcapsular cataract. After routine cataract surgery, the anterior subcapsular cataractous tissue was obtained as an anterior capsulorhexis flap and prepared as a wholemount for histological analysis. The wholemount consisted of a well-demarcated central grayish-white plaque surrounded by transparent capsule, corroborating the slit-lamp biomicroscopic appearance. Higher magnification of the plaque revealed a fibrous and amorphous mass, most likely extracellular matrix owing to the presence of irregularly arranged bundled strands of fibrils, typical of collagen. Lens epithelial cells at the plaque were densely packed and myofibroblast-like and immunoreactive for alpha-smooth muscle actin. In contrast, lens epithelial cells more distant from the plaque retained their regular cuboidal arrangement and regular spacing, and were not labeled for alpha-smooth muscle actin, similar to lens epithelial cells obtained from a non-cataractous case. Conclusions. The presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin-reactive elongated cells at the plaque suggests that the cuboidal lens epithelial cells making up the anterior subcapsular cataract have transdifferentiated into spindle-shaped myofibroblastic cells that produce and deposit aberrant extracellular matrix. This transdifferentiation process, more commonly known as an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributes to a fibrotic response leading to the development of human anterior subcapsular cataract.
1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 AC machines; matrix converters; vector control; wind energy conversion systems        	This paper presents a new variable speed wind energy conversion systems (WECS). It is based on a six-phase asymmetrical squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) and a matrix converter (MC) as power electronic interface between six-phase SCIG and electrical network. The analysis employs a rotor flux vector control algorithm and a scalar strategy modulated MC to control the generator. Characteristics of MC are used for maximizing the power tracking control when different wind speeds and delivering powers to the grid are simultaneously considered. The MC provides sinusoidal input and output voltages and a unity power factor, but causes an asymmetry in the generator. A current control strategy including the method of suppressing imbalance caused by this asymmetry is discussed. Some numerical simulations are carried out showing the effectiveness of the proposed WECS topology.

5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 Hormone therapy; Progestin; Aging; Menopause; Memory; Cognition        	Introduction: For decades, progestins have been included in hormone therapies (HT) prescribed to women to offset the risk of unopposed estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. However, the potential effects on cognition of subcategories of clinically used progestins have been largely unexplored. Methods: In two studies, the present investigation evaluated the cognitive effects of norethindrone acetate (NETA), levonorgestrel (LEVO), and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) on the water radial-arm maze (WRAM) and Morris water maze (MM) in middle-aged ovariectomized rats. Results: In Study 1, six-weeks of a high-dose NETA treatment impaired learning and delayed retention on the WRAM, and impaired reference memory on the MM. Low-dose NETA treatment impaired delayed retention on the WRAM. In Study 2, high-dose NETA treatment was reduced to four-weeks and compared to MPA and LEVO. As previously shown, MPA impaired working memory performance during the latter-most portion of testing, at the highest working memory load, impaired delayed retention on the WRAM, and impaired reference memory on the MM. NETA also impaired performance on these WRAM and MM measures. Interestingly, LEVO did not impair performance, but instead enhanced learning on the WRAM. Conclusions: The current study corroborates previous evidence that the most commonly prescribed FDA approved progestin for HT, MPA, impairs learning and memory in the ovariectomized middle-aged rat. When progestins from two different additional subcategories were investigated, NETA impaired learning and memory similarly to MPA, but LEVO enhanced learning. Future research is warranted to determine LEVO's potential as an ideal progestin for optimal health in women, including for cognition. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 Atrial fibrillation; Catheter ablation; Left atrial appendage emptying flow velocity; NT-proBNP        	Multiple studies have shown the efficacy and potentially curative effect of catheter ablation (CA). However, CA is always accompanied by a considerable recurrence rate for atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that pre-procedure assessments of baseline left atrial appendage emptying flow velocity (LAAFV) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels would help identify abnormal atrial substrate and offer preliminary evidence regarding susceptibility to AF recurrence in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, respectively. In 120 patients with AF (paroxysmal, 55; persistent, 65), transesophageal echocardiography was performed with assessment of LAAFV and NT-proBNP was measured before the first AF ablation. After 12 months of follow-up, 16 patients (29.1%) in the paroxysmal AF and 23 patients (35.4%) in the persistent AF experienced recurrence of AF. In ROC analysis, a NT-proBNP value of ae291 pg/ml in the paroxysmal AF and ae368 pg/ml in the persistent AF discriminated AFR and non-AFR with the greatest sensitivity and specificity. In multivariate regression analysis, LAAFV (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98, p = 0.023) was identified as an independent predictor of AFR in the paroxysmal AF population post-CA after adjustment for other risk factors; however, in the persistent AF population, LAAFV (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.94, p = 0.007) and a NT-proBNP value ae368 pg/ml (OR 18.29, 95% CI 1.32-252.84, p = 0.030) were identified as independent predictors for rhythm outcome compared to other parameters. In patients with persistent AF, elevated plasma NT-proBNP concentrations combined with low LAAFV were associated with rhythm outcome after AF ablation; however, LAAFV was the only independent predictor of CA efficacy in patients with paroxysmal AF.

There is at least one extrahepatic manifestation in 50% of HCV patients, which makes the prognosis and mortality worse. The pathomechanisms included are cryoglobulin production, immunmechanisms, and direct viral effects. The authors summarize the main extrahepatic manifestations, as well as treatment possibilities. The aim is to draw attention to this colourful infection in order to improve the recognition in the era of the new effective direct antiviral agents.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Fault; Thermal image; Induction motor; Diagnostics; Recognition        	Single-phase induction motors are used in the industry commonly. Induction motors are not expensive, so it is a reason to use them. Diagnostics of faults is very important. It prevents financial loss and unplanned downtimes causes by faults. In this paper the authors described fault diagnostic techniques of the single-phase induction motor. Presented techniques were based on the analysis of thermal images of electric motor. The authors measured and analysed 3 states of the single-phase induction motor. In this paper an original method of the feature extraction of thermal images called MoASoS (Method of Area Selection of States) was presented. The proposed method - MoASoS and an image histogram were used to form feature vectors. Classification of the obtained vectors was performed by NN (Nearest Neighbour classifier) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The described fault diagnostic techniques are useful for reliability of the single-phase induction motors and other rotating electrical machines such as: three-phase induction motors, synchronous motors, DC motors.

With the integrated topology reduces the number control switches. The proposed converter has the advantage of low bulk capacitor voltage and only single control switch hence reduce in complexity in control and cost. Sub-harmonic oscillations which are produced in conventional current controller. By adding an external compensating signal effect of oscillations are reduced and performance of the converter is improved. The proposed scheme is implemented in real time by TMS320F2812 digital signal processor (DSP) board. The performance of converter is verified both experimentally and by simulation at different load and line conditions. The proposed converter is designed for 90-230 V, 50 Hz AC input, 48 V DC output and operating at 100 kHz switching frequency. The Experimental results shows that the DSP-based fuzzy controlled single phase single switch integrated PFC converter achieve high power factor and satisfies IEC-61000-3-2 and other European input current harmonic limits for Class-C & Class-D applications.

An initiative to reproduce these findings conducted by Eerland et al. (2016) yielded a lack of replication. Eerland et al. have suggested that the original effect was likely driven by a Type I error produced by methodological aspects of the experiment, including low sample size. Recent conceptual replications of Hart and Albarracin's effect (Sherrill, Eerland, Zwaan, & Magliano, 2015), however, might imply the effect could be contingent on sample characteristics.
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 Flexible Cartesian manipulator; Active vibration suppression; Characteristic model; Nonlinear control; Adaptive control        	A flexible Cartesian manipulator is a coupling system with a moving rigid body and flexible structures. Thus, vibration suppression problem must be solved to guarantee the stability and control accuracy. A characteristic model based nonlinear golden section adaptive control (CMNGSAC) algorithm is implemented to suppress the vibration of a flexible Cartesian smart material manipulator driven by a ballscrew mechanism using an AC servomotor. The system modeling is derived to recognize the dynamical characteristics. The closed loop stability is analyzed based on the model. Also, an experimental setup is constructed to verify the adopted method. Experimental comparison studies are conducted for modal frequencies' identification and active vibration control of the flexible manipulator. The active vibration control experiments include set-point vibration control responses, vibration suppression under resonant excitation and simultaneous translating and vibration suppression using different control methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the controller can suppress both the larger and the lower amplitude vibration near the equilibrium point effectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

5	50	122	Medical 	 Sports Injuries  	 ankle injury; ankle support; economic analysis; absenteeism; physiotherapist; taping        	Aims and objectivesTo examine the cost-effectiveness of semi-rigid ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time acute ankle sprains. DesignEconomic evaluation based on cost-utility analysis. BackgroundAnkle sprains are a source of morbidity and absenteeism from work, accounting for 15-20% of all sports injuries. Semi-rigid ankle brace and taping are functional treatment interventions used by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists and Nurses to facilitate return to work following acute ankle sprains. MethodsA decision model analysis, based on cost-utility analysis from the perspective of National Health Service was used. The primary outcomes measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, based on quality-adjusted life years. Costs and quality of life data were derived from published literature, while model clinical probabilities were sourced from Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists. ResultsThe cost and quality adjusted life years gained using semi-rigid ankle brace was 184 and 0.72 respectively. However, the cost and quality adjusted life years gained following taping was 155 and 0.61 respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the semi-rigid brace was 263 pound per quality adjusted life year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ankle brace provided the highest net-benefit, hence the preferred option. ConclusionTaping is a cheaper intervention compared with ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time ankle sprains. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio observed for ankle brace was less than the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold and the intervention had a higher net-benefit, suggesting that it is a cost-effective intervention. Decision-makers may be willing to pay 263 pound for an additional gain in quality adjusted life year. Relevance to clinical practiceThe findings of this economic evaluation provide justification for the use of semi-rigid ankle brace by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists and Nurses to facilitate return to work in individuals with first-time ankle sprains.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 Adenylation; Adenylate; forming; Hydroxamate; MesG; Enzyme assay        	Adenylation is a crucial enzymatic process in the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) derived natural products. Adenylation domains are considered the gatekeepers of NRPSs since they select, activate, and load the carboxylic acid substrate onto a downstream peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain of the NRPS. We describe a coupled continuous kinetic assay for NRPS adenylation domains that substitutes the PCP domain with hydroxylamine as the acceptor molecule. The pyrophosphate released from the first-half reaction is then measured using a two-enzyme coupling system, which detects conversion of the chromogenic substrate 7-methylthioguanosine (MesG) to 7-methylthioguanine. From profiling substrate specificity of unknown or engineered adenylation domains to studying chemical inhibition of adenylating enzymes, this robust assay will be of widespread utility in the broad field NRPS enzymology.
1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Actuator control; adaptive control; automotive; brake-by-wire (BBW); nonlinear control        	In this paper, a cascade control architecture for a brake-by-wire system suitable for motor racing applications is described. The system is composed of an electromechanical actuator, i.e., an electric motor, a transmission, a master cylinder, and a traditional hydraulic brake (pipe and caliper). Starting from a control-oriented model, a cascade control is proposed. An innerloop controls the position; an outer the pressure. The outer loop features an adaptation mechanism to cope with the intrinsic timevarying nonlinearity of the position-pressure relationship. The stability and robustness of the pressure loop are proven. Extensive experimental validation, conducted on an instrumented motorbike on a test circuit by a professional rider, shows the performance of the system.
3	2	54	MAE 	 Manufacturing engineering  	 Factory Templates; Factory Life Cycle; Estimation; Management Knowledge; Digital Factory; Enterprise Reference Model        	"The global industry is currently facing a growing increase in the competitiveness that forces companies to adopt and develop new strategies and methods of production. Therefore, one of the most relevant challenges in manufacturing engineering is innovatively integrating Product, Process and Factory dimensions and life cycles, in a holistic approach, from design to recycling/disposal and reuse. The challenge faced here is the synchronization and simultaneous generation of all three-domain models by integrating manufacturing engineering knowledge into the early stage of the modelling and planning processes. The next generation of factories has to be modular, scalable, flexible, open, agile and knowledge-based in order to be able to adapt, in real time, to the continuously changing market demands, technology options and regulations. Therefore, integration, flexibility and efficiency requirements and the ability to simulate the production life cycle of a factory play a crucial role in decreasing ramp-up and design times. Furthermore they play a crucial role in improving the performance in the evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing facilities, in supporting management decisions and providing tools that can guarantee real-time performance monitoring. Therefore, it is necessary to research and implement the underlying models and ideas during the foundation stage of a new conceptual framework, which is designed to be implemented in the next generation of factories. This will be supported by suitable Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and digital infrastructures and should lay down the foundations for future applications in this research area the industrial paradigm of ""Factory as a Product"". In line with the context presented here, we propose the development of factory templates to address the design and operation practices throughout the entire life cycle of the factory. Different dimensions of the factory templates are presented in this paper; they cover the design and creation of the factory, its remodelling and even the disassembly and recycling stages. This entire study takes into account relevant factors such as costs, quality, time, flexibility, environmental and social issues and energy efficiency. Throughout the article, different kinds of models are presented, which describe and adjust the structure of the analysis, design and development of a factory integration project that helps provide a formal analysis of the system. Furthermore, templates integrating the factory's response to internal and external disturbances will also be developed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 Alcohol; Alcohol abuse; Internet addiction; Internet gaming disorder; Psychopathology; Adolescents        	In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use. For the first time associations between adolescent problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use due to common psychopathological factors were identified. However, in addition to shared factors, we found also specific psychopathological correlates associated with these two behavior patterns. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	22	94	Medical 	 Healthy Sleep  	 vitamin D; sleep; cohort; elderly        	Study Objectives: Maintaining adequate serum levels of vitamin D may be important for sleep duration and quality; however, these associations are not well understood. We examined whether levels of serum 25(OH)D are associated with objective measures of sleep in older men. Setting and Participants: Cross-sectional study within a large cohort of community-dwelling older men, the MrOS study. Interventions: Among 3,048 men age 68 years or older, we measured total serum vitamin D. Objective estimates of nightly total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and wake time after sleep onset (WASO) were obtained using wrist actigraphy worn for an average of 5 consecutive 24-h periods. Results: 16.4% of this study population had low levels of vitamin D (< 20.3 ng/mL 25(OH)D). Lower serum vitamin D levels were associated with a higher odds of short (= 40.06 ng/mL) versus lowest (< 20.3 ng/mL) quartile of 25(OH)D, 2.15; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.21-3.79; P-trend = 0.004) as well as increased odds of actigraphy-measured sleep efficiency of less than 70% (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.97-2.18; P-trend = 0.004), after controlling for age, clinic, season, comorbidities, body mass index, and physical and cognitive function. Lower vitamin D levels were also associated with increased WASO in age-adjusted, but not multivariable adjusted models Conclusions: Among older men, low levels of total serum 25(OH)D are associated with poorer sleep including short sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency. These findings, if confirmed by others, suggest a potential role for vitamin D in maintaining healthy sleep.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 subcritical water extraction; Siraitia grosvenorii; mogrosides; phenols; antioxidant capacity        	Extracts from lo-han-kuo (Siraitia grosvenorii) are of high sweetness and low calories, and they have been widely used as a natural sweetener to reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes. In the current study, lo-han-kuo extracts were extracted using subcritical water under different operation condition. The study revealed that the optimal extracting parameters were: extraction time of 20 min, extraction temperature of 140 degrees C, and the addition of 15% ethanol. Antioxidant activity, contents of total flavonoids, and total phenolic compounds of lo-han-kuo extracts were also investigated. A mathematical model was established to describe the relationship between antioxidant capacity and content of bioactive components in lo-han-kuo extract, and it was found that antioxidant capacity of the extracts was mainly attributed to the yields of total mogrosides (P<0.05).
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 bare-patch restoration; carbon loss; carbon sequestration; check dams; low-cost restoration        	We analysed the extent of ecological damage of gully and inter-gully erosion in a sub-catchment situated in the drylands (300mmyr(-1)) of the winter rainfall area of South Africa where small-stock farming on rangeland is the main source of income. We applied low-cost measures to revegetate the bare sites of the inter-gully erosion and stabilised gully erosion by loosening soil surfaces and applying geotextile and constructing check dams to reverse gully erosion. We compared vegetation cover, silt accumulation and penetration resistance of the soil upslope of the check dams with the situation downslope of the check dams and untreated gullies as controls. For the treated bare patches, we compared penetration resistance and vegetation cover with untreated controls. Two years after implementation, the restoration measures resulted in increased soil depth and vegetation cover upslope of the check dams and increased vegetation cover on the treated bare patches. We calculated the net present value of the restoration measures based on the financial benefit that a landowner can realistically expect under current economic and governance conditions (i.e. payment for additional livestock and for C sequestration). At the current rates of return for livestock production or carbon sequestration over a 20-year period, rehabilitation of this sort is not financially feasible for private landowners. Either the current payment for carbon sequestration would have to be increased by a magnitude of 40-80, or restoration measures would have to be funded by the public or private sector to make them financially viable for landowners.

5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 Transient Elastography; ElastPQ; Liver stiffness; Chronic hepatitis B; Chronic hepatitis C        	The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a point shear wave elastography using ARFI technique - ElastPQ in patients with B and C chronic hepatopathies, using Transient Elastography (TE) as the reference method, since it is a validated method for liver fibrosis assessment. Subjects and methods: the study included 228 consecutive subjects with chronic hepatopathies (26% HBV, 74% HCV) from whom 51% had liver cirrhosis. Liver stiffness (LS) was evaluated in the same session by means of 2 elastographic methods: TE (FibroScan, EchoSens) and ElastPQ (Affinity, Philips) techniques. For TE 10 valid LS measurements were performed for each patient and the median value was calculated. Reliable LS measurements by TE (M or XL probe) were considered the median value of 10 LS measurements with a success rate >60% and an interquartile range= 2)- 7.0 kPa, severe fibrosis (F >= 3)- 9.5 kPa and for liver cirrhosis (F = 4)-12 kPa (Tsochatzis et al., 2011). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) were used to assess the diagnostic performance of ElastPQ correlations between ElastPQ and TE were evaluated. Results: Valid LS measurements were obtained in 90.7% (207/228) cases by means of TE and in 98.7% (225/228) cases with ElastPQ. In the final analysis 205 patients were included. The ElastPQ values ranged from 232 to 44.07 kPa (median = 10.42 kPa). Based on TE cut-off values (Tsochatzis et al., 2011) we divided our cohort into 4 groups: F0-F1:61/205 (29.8%); F2: 14/205 (6.8%); F3: 15/205 (7.3%); F = 4: 115/205 (56.1%). The best cut-off values for discriminating, significant, severe fibrosis and cirrhosis were 7.2, 8.5 and 8.9 kPa, respectively. The AUROCs were calculated considering TE as the reference method: 0.94 for significant fibrosis (F >= 2), 0.97 for severe fibrosis (F >= 3) and 0.97 for cirrhosis (F = 4). In our cohort there was a strong correlation between measurements obtained by Transient Elastography and ElastPQ (r = 0.85, p < 0.001). Conclusions: ElastPQ seems to have a good diagnostic accuracy for staging liver fibrosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We describe a class of recurrent convolutional architectures which is end-to-end trainable and suitable for large-scale visual understanding tasks, and demonstrate the value of these models for activity recognition, image captioning, and video description. In contrast to previous models which assume a fixed visual representation or perform simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are ""doubly deep"" in that they learn compositional representations in space and time. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Differentiable recurrent models are appealing in that they can directly map variable-length inputs (e.g., videos) to variable-length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent sequence models are directly connected to modern visual convolutional network models and can be jointly trained to learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show that such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined or optimized."
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Common subexpression elimination (CSE); Cyclotomic fast fourier transforms (CFFTs); Multiple constant multiplication (MCM)        	The frequency transformation methods like fast fourier transform algorithms can be competently used in realization of discrete fourier transforms over Galois field, which have broad applications in network security and digital communication in error correcting codes. The cyclotomic fast fourier transform (CFFT) is a type of fast fourier transform algorithm over finite fields This method utilizes the benefit of cyclic decomposition. The cyclotomic breakdown of input data is used to reduce the number of operations which can be equally exploited to get a set by set treatment of the input sequence. Common subexpression elimination (CSE) is an useful optimization process to solve the multiple constant multiplication problems. In this paper, common subexpression elimination algorithm for cyclotomic fast fourier transform over fixed field 23 is designed. Using CSE algorithm, we reduce the additive complexities of cyclotomic fast fourier transform. The design of CSE is to spot regular patterns that are present in expressions more than once and replace them with a single variable. Using above method every regular pattern calculates only once, thus minimizing the area of CFFT architecture required in VLSI implementation.
2	3	36	Psychology  	 Nonverbal communication  	 Facebook (TM); Computer-mediated communication; Emotion; Nonverbal communication; Attachment        	The present study investigates people's perceived likelihood of experiencing negative emotion in response to a potentially jealousy-inducing Facebook wall post that was ostensibly sent by a rival. Facebook messages were varied so that participants (n = 821) viewed a message containing text only or text plus either an attractive or unattractive photo of the sender, a winking face emoticon, words in all capitals, or triple exclamation points. Participants were then asked to indicate the degree of negative emotion they would feel if they saw this message on their romantic partner's Facebook wall. The addition of wink-face emoticons and physical attractiveness cues in a Facebook wall post contributed to differences in likely experienced emotion. Participants also reported a greater likelihood of experiencing negative emotion if they were high in preoccupied attachment and low in dismissive attachment. Finally, women reported being more likely to experience negative interpersonal affect in response to the Facebook post than did men. Implications for the role nonverbal cues play in computer-mediated contexts, such as Facebook, are discussed.
5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 cost-effectiveness; knee; microfracture; osteochondral autograft transplantation; autologous chondrocyte implantation        	Background: Numerous surgical options exist to treat chondral lesions in the knee, including microfracture (MFx), osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT), first-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI-1), and next-generation ACI (ACI-2). Purpose: To compare the cost-effectiveness of MFx, OAT, and ACI-1. The secondary purpose of this study was to compare the functional outcomes of MFx, OAT, ACI-1, and ACI-2. Study Design: Systematic review; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: Two independent reviewers conducted an online literature search of 2 databases for level 1 and 2 studies using the Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and/or Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) Knee Score. A weighted mean difference in pre- to postoperative functional outcome score was calculated for each treatment. The mean per-patient costs associated with MFx, OAT, and ACI-1 were determined from a recent publication based on review of a national private insurance database. The cost for each procedure was then divided by the weighted mean difference in functional outcome score to give the cost-per-point change in outcome score. Results: A total of 12 studies (6 level 1, 6 level 2) met the inclusion criteria for the functional outcome analysis, including 730 knees (MFx, n = 300; OAT, n = 90; ACI-1, n = 68; ACI-2, n = 272). The mean follow-up was not significantly different between groups (MFx, 29.4 months; OAT, 38.3 months; ACI-1, 19.0 months; ACI-2, 26.7 months). The mean increase in functional outcome score was 23 for MFx, 19 for OAT, 20 for ACI-1, and 35 for ACI-2. The change in functional outcome score was significantly greater for ACI-2 when compared with all other treatments (P < .0001). The cost-per-point change in functional outcome score was $200.59 for MFx, $313.84 for OAT, and $536.59 for ACI-1. Conclusion: MFx, OAT, ACI-1, and ACI-2 are effective surgical procedures for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee. All 4 treatments led to an increase in functional outcome scores postoperatively with a short-term follow-up. ACI-2 had a statistically greater improvement in functional outcome scores as compared with the other 3 procedures. MFx was found to be the most cost-effective treatment option and ACI-1 the least cost-effective.

0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 constrained clustering; data simulation; Monte Carlo; permutation testing; PRIMER-E; SIMPROF        	Clustering data continues to be a highly active area of data analysis, and resemblance profiles are being incorporated into ecological methodologies as a hypothesis testing-based approach to clustering multivariate data. However, these new clustering techniques have not been rigorously tested to determine the performance variability based on the algorithm's assumptions or any underlying data structures. Here, we use simulation studies to estimate the statistical error rates for the hypothesis test for multivariate structure based on dissimilarity profiles (DISPROF). We concurrently tested a widely used algorithm that employs the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) to estimate the proficiency of clustering with DISPROF as a decision criterion. We simulated unstructured multivariate data from different probability distributions with increasing numbers of objects and descriptors, and grouped data with increasing overlap, overdispersion for ecological data, and correlation among descriptors within groups. Using simulated data, we measured the resolution and correspondence of clustering solutions achieved by DISPROF with UPGMA against the reference grouping partitions used to simulate the structured test datasets. Our results highlight the dynamic interactions between dataset dimensionality, group overlap, and the properties of the descriptors within a group (i.e., overdispersion or correlation structure) that are relevant to resemblance profiles as a clustering criterion for multivariate data. These methods are particularly useful for multivariate ecological datasets that benefit from distance-based statistical analyses. We propose guidelines for using DISPROF as a clustering decision tool that will help future users avoid potential pitfalls during the application of methods and the interpretation of results.
0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 eLearning ecosystems; Information systems; Architectural pattern; Software engineering; Open Source software        	Knowledge management within companies and institutions is one of the main problems when defining and developing new solutions to improve information systems. Currently, information systems have evolved into technological ecosystems that are a set of different components related to each other through information flows in a physical environment that supports these flows, where users are part of the ecosystem. Particularly, during the last several years, the Open Source software has been used to develop these technological solutions. The aim of this paper is to formalize an architectural pattern to support the right description and implementation of eLearning ecosystems. The theoretical basis has been provided in previous works by using a comparative analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats of several real case studies developed in different contexts. The problems detected through the previous analysis have been modelled using the Business Process Model and Notation. Next, the pattern has been formalized with the Service oriented architecture Modelling Language. Finally, the pattern has been tested in a real context, namely, an institutional development for the Spanish Public Administration, which has demonstrated that the pattern works properly. As a result, we have obtained a set of Business Process Model and Notation diagrams that provide a high abstraction level for the main detected problems in eLearning ecosystems. We have also obtained an architectural pattern composed of several layers and a set of external elements that provides a solution to these problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 Computer programming; Intelligent tutoring system; Solution-based environments; Formative assessment        	Nowadays, intelligent tutoring systems are considered an effective research tool for learning systems and problem-solving skill improvement. Nonetheless, such individualized systems may cause students to lose learning motivation when interaction and timely guidance are lacking. In order to address this problem, a solution-based intelligent tutoring system (SITS) is integrated with an online game-based formative assessment game called tic-tac-toe quiz for single-player (TRIS-Q-SP) for learning computer programming. This assessment game combines tic-tac-toe with online assessment, and the rules of tic-tac-toe are revised to stimulate students to use online formative assessment actively. Finally, an experimental study is devised to assess the success of SITS, and significant achievements are observed for the experimental group, besides enjoyment and positive opinions toward the TRIS-Q-SP. Therefore, the practical use of SITS is supported, as the results indicate considerable advantages for the experimental group over the control group. The findings also reveal that immediate elaborated feedback upon answering each question in TRIS-Q-SP is part of an optimal design.

The molecular basis of most pustular skin conditions has remained unknown. Objective: We sought to investigate the molecular basis of 3 pustular skin disorders: generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Methods: Microarray analyses were performed to profile genome-wide gene expression of skin biopsy specimens obtained from patients with GPP, PPP, or AGEP and healthy control subjects. Functional enrichment, gene network, and k-means clustering analyses were used to identify molecular pathways dysregulated in patients with these disorders. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to determine protein localization. Quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA were used to determine transcript and secreted cytokine levels. Small interfering RNA was used to decrease transcript levels. Results: Molecules and pathways related to neutrophil chemotaxis emerged as common alterations in patients with GPP, PPP, and AGEP, which is consistent with the pustular phenotypes. Expression of two 6-transmembrane epithelial antigens of the prostate (STEAP) proteins, STEAP1 and STEAP4, was increased in patients' skin and colocalized with IL-36 gamma around neutrophilic pustules. STEAP1/4 expression clustered with and positively correlated with that of IL-1, the IL-36 family proteins, and CXCL1/8. STEAP4 expression was activated by cytokines and suppressed by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2, whereas STEAP1 expression appeared less prone to such dynamic regulation. Importantly, STEAP1/4 knockdown resulted in impaired induction of a broad spectrum of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-36, and the neutrophil chemotaxins CXCL1 and CXCL8. STEAP1/4 knockdown also reduced the ability of keratinocytes to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. Conclusion: Transcriptomic changes in 3 pustular skin disorders, GPP, PPP, and AGEP, converged on neutrophil chemotaxis and diapedesis and cytokines known to drive neutrophil-rich inflammatory processes, including IL-1 and members of the IL-36 family. STEAP1 and STEAP4 positively regulate the induction of proinflammatory neutrophil-activating cytokines.
5	17	89	Medical 	 Digestive Health  	 feeding strategy; health status; pre-weaning; rabbit        	Post-weaning feed restriction is a common practice in rabbit farming to reduce mortality, but results in lower growth performance and slaughter weights. This study aimed to assess the influence of 2 diets both rich in fibre and low in starch, with high or low digestible energy (DE) and digestible protein (DP) contents for a constant DP/DE ratio offered from 18 to 70 d of age, on the growth performance and health parameters of rabbits. Eight hundred rabbit kits were divided in 2 experimental groups differing in the feed offered from 18 to 70 d: a high concentrate diet (HC group; 10.37 MJ DE/kg DM and 102 g DP/kg DM) or low concentrate diet (LC group; 9.63 MJ DE/kg DM and 95 g DP/kg DM). Feed was offered ad libitum before weaning (35 d) and from 63 to 70 d, while feed offered from 35 to 63 d was controlled to obtain similar DE intake in both groups. Feed intake, animal weights and health status were recorded weekly. Mortality was recorded daily. Feed intake was similar in both groups before weaning (P=0.204), and consequently the DE intake was higher in the HC group compared to the LC group before weaning (3.91 vs. 3.39 MJ, respectively; P=0.017). Feed intake from 63 to 70 d was lower in the HO than in the LC group (229 vs. 239 g/d/kit, respectively; P<0.001). Total DE ingested after weaning was similar in both groups (45.44 MJ; P=0.143). Kits were heavier in the HO group throughout the study (P<0.05). A higher average daily gain during the periods of 18-28, 35-42 and 56-63 d was seen in the HO group (+8.1%, +16.8% and +4.5%, respectively; P<0.05). Mortality and morbidity rates were similar between groups throughout the study (P=1.0 and P=0.104, respectively). Our results suggest that when the feed intake after weaning is controlled, i) the feeding strategy before weaning determines the weight at weaning and at slaughter age; and ii) rabbits fed a diet more highly concentrated but rich in fibre increase their growth performance without negative consequences on their digestive health.
2	0	33	Psychology  	 Prejudice  	 bisexuality; gay; health disparities; survey methodology        	Purpose: Researchers are increasingly using national population surveys (NPS) to understand the health of gay and bisexual men (GBM). However, valid inference from these surveys depends on accurate identification of GBM. Methods: We asked 8126 GBM in an anonymous, online, community-recruited survey about their willingness to reveal their sexual orientation in NPS. Results: Overall, 30% indicated that they would not reveal their sexual orientation; however, there were differences in frequencies according to sexual orientation, relationship status, age, HIV status, living environment, education, income, and ethnicity. Conclusion: NPS might not be fully representative of GBM due to misclassification errors stemming from unwillingness to disclose.
1	11	28	ECE 	 Control engineering  	 History matching; Data assimilation; Ensemble Kalman filter; Finite size ensemble Kalman filter; RMSE        	Generally reservoir simulation results show considerable distance from actual behavior of system which is mainly due to poor initial estimates of model parameters. The problem of improving the property estimates using reservoir observations is called history matching which is an essential and inseparable part of reservoir studies. In recent years a promising tool from control engineering called ensemble filtering is used in history matching problems which could be used to quantify the uncertainty in predictions. This paper focuses on comparison of traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and a relatively new form of ensemble filters called finite size ensemble transform Kalman filter on a small size benchmark model. This study tries to estimate the porosity and permeability fields by assimilating production data in 13 time steps. A weighting approach is used as modification to filter procedure. The results show traditional ensemble Kalman filter with localization has a better performance in a problem with a small ensemble but this superiority comes with more computational cost.

5	26	98	Medical 	 HIV/AIDS  	 SRH; STIs; Risk perception; Knowledge; Contraceptive methods; University students; Ethiopia        	Background: Youths in universities are at high risk of STIs and SRH problems in Ethiopia. However, students did not perceive themselves at risk of STI/HIV infection though reports showed they were sexually active, had multiple sexual partners and reported symptoms of STIs. Having recognized the threat posed by SRH problems, this study aimed to assess the SRH experiences, knowledge, and problems among university students at Ambo University in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo University main campus from January to February 2015 using mixed approach of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods. Proportionate stratified sampling technique was used to select 400 survey respondents and purposive sampling was employed to identify 10 in-depth interviewees. The quantitative data was coded, entered to SPSS and descriptively analyzed, while the qualitative data was categorically organized, repeatedly reviewed and thematically analyzed. Results: Mean age during first sex of 17.29 +/- SD 2.21 and mean number of past 12 months regular sexual partners of 1.36 +/- SD 0.505 were recorded. Only 21.1% of survey respondents perceived themselves to be at risk of HIV. Almost all survey respondents ever heard of STIs (94.5%) and HIV/AIDS (98%), and 89.4% knew modern contraceptives such as pills (64.8%) and condoms (56.8%). Despite awareness of STIs including HIV/AIDS, more than one fifth (22.8%) had any of the STIs in the past one year. Although the quantitative data showed unwanted pregnancy (5%) and abortion (2.5%) existed in the campus minimally, high rates of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion were reported in the qualitative data. Conclusions: SRH/STIs were problems among students of the university. Although students knew about STIs, the STI infection rate in the past year was quite high, and was almost as high as the percentage of students who reported sexual activity in the past year. Though reported by a minority of students, unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion may also be a problem. The university thus needs to launch a program directed towards STIs and SRH problems, particularly among female students.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 rainwater harvesting; urban water; rainfall variability; Accra; Ghana        	This article examines the challenges associated with rainwater harvesting and usage in peri-urban Accra. Data collected from 357 heads of household reveal that rainwater harvesting has the potential to supplement existing water sources in peri-urban Accra. However, high investment costs for rainwater harvesting facilities, short-term tenancy arrangements, the perception that rainwater is not clean, and the unique dry climate of the Accra Plains emerge as key challenges limiting domestic use of rainwater. Public education for house owners to invest in rainwater harvesting facilities and governmental support will be needed to increase investment in rainwater harvesting, purification and usage.
5	9	81	Medical 	 Skin Care  	 New product adoption; diffusion of innovation; perceived innovation characteristics; consumer innovativeness and consumer behavior; demographics; discriminant analysis        	Till the last decade it was unthinkable that skin care would be a category where consumers would like to spend the most. India has a strong economic performance and youthful demographic structure, ensuring a great future for cosmetic Industry. All that marketers and retailers need to do to be successful, is bring out innovation and price the products efficiently and intelligently. New product innovation is defined as the degree to which an individual adopts innovations relatively earlier than other members in his or her social system. Diffusion refers to the process in which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system (Rogers, 1995). Celebrities became more vocal about their grooming habits, sharing self-grooming details on television and other advertising media have led to spurge in the sale of fairness creams. It is not surprising that some of the leading cosmetic manufacturers have been introducing skin care lines specifically tailored to males. This present study attempts to build possible associations based on the previous researches between socio demographics, perceived innovation characteristics, consumer innovativeness and new product adoption behavior owing to the product innovations in skin care range with special reference to fairness creams for males.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 Stress management; Internet; Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT); Self-help; e-health; Adjustment disorder with anxiety        	Introduction.- Cognitive-behavioural stress management programs have been studied in many countries. Many reports have shown beyond a doubt their efficacy to reduce perceived stress, anxiety symptoms and to improve quality of life of patients. Considering the very large number of people who could benefit from such programs but are unable to reach them, self-help programs have been offered. First presented as books (bibliotherapy), these programs then became enriched by computing and digital supports. Regrettably, many of the programs of stress management based on the Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) both in face-to-face and on digital support have been little evaluated in France. To our knowledge, the Seren@ctif program is the first French language self-help program of stress management proposed on digital support. Aim of the study.- We led a feasibility study of this program on 10 patients responding to the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety according to the DSM IV criteria. Methods.- The program includes 5 weekly sessions that the patient follows in our unit from a web site. He benefits from minimal contact with a medical member of staff before and after every session. Right from the first session an USB key is supplied to the patient containing videos, audio files, self-help book portfolio in the form of an e-guide; and log books with the exercises to be realized between each sessions of the 5 session program. The patient is encouraged to practice 20 minutes of exercises 5 or 6 days per week. The program's feasibility has been assessed in accordance with a standard satisfaction scale. Anxiety symptomatology has been quantified thanks to the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y-S). Results.- After the scheduled 5 weeks, good results were found in terms of acceptability and attractiveness. The average score to the satisfaction survey was at least equal to 4 out of 5 for each item. The mean score on the STAI-State decreased from 53,4 (SD: 8,29) to 44,2 (SD: 7,73) following the intervention. Discussion.- The Seren@ctif program may be useful within the framework of a psychoeducative approach. It could also be advised for people suffering from anxiety related to stress. Soon, the program will be tested on patients with usual care suffering from adjustment disorder with anxiety in order to precisely assess its benefits. (C) 2016 L'Encephale, Paris.
5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 Au-poly(methylene blue); Polydopamine-Au-HRP; Peptide; Prostate specific antigen; Electrochemical biosensor; Enzyme-catalyzed precipitation reaction        	In general, current difference (AI) due to immunoreactions is significant in determining biosensor sensitivity. In this work, a new strategy of triple sensitivity amplification for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was developed. Au-poly(methylene blue) (Au-PMB) was implemented as a redox species with strong current signal at-0.144 V and used to fabricate the substrate of the biosensor. Conductive reduced graphene oxide-Au nanocomposites (Au-rGO) were coated on the Au-PMB modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to amplify current signal. After peptides (CEHSSKLQLAK-NH2) were fixed on the Au-rGO/AuPMB/GCE, the fixed peptides reacted with glutaraldehyde to immobilize polydopamine-Au-horse radish peroxidase nanocomposites (PDA-Au-HRP). The electrochemical sensing interface for PSA was realized. Due to smaller resistance compared to antibodies, the peptides which can be cleaved specifically by PSA were employed. After the incubation of PSA, a large AI was obtained and behaved as the decrease of current signal. Then the remaining PDA-Au-HRP accelerated an enzyme-catalyzed precipitation reaction between 4-chloro-1naphthol and H2O2. A further decrease in current signal (namely the increase in Delta I) resulted from the poorly conductive precipitation adhering onto the biosensor. The designed biosensor presented a wide linear range from 1.0 fg m(-1) to 100 ngmL(-1) with an ultralow detection limit of 0.11 fg mL(-1)
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 racial categorization; person perception; multiracials; motivation to control prejudice        	Multiracial individuals often do not easily fit into existing racial categories. Perceivers may adopt a novel racial category to categorize multiracial targets, but their willingness to do so may depend on their motivations. We investigated whether perceivers' levels of internal motivation to control prejudice (IMS) and external motivation to control prejudice (EMS) predicted their likelihood of categorizing Black-White multiracial faces as Multiracial. Across four studies, IMS positively predicted perceivers' categorizations of multiracial faces as Multiracial. The association between IMS and Multiracial categorizations was strongest when faces were most racially ambiguous. Explicit prejudice, implicit prejudice, and interracial contact were ruled out as explanations for the relationship between IMS and Multiracial categorizations. EMS may be negatively associated with the use of the Multiracial category. Therefore, perceivers' motivations to control prejudice have important implications for racial categorization processes.
3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 Design methodology; design optimization; electric vehicles (EVs); permanent-magnet (PM) machines        	This paper discusses the development of new winding configuration for six-phase permanent-magnet (PM) machines with 18 slots and 8 poles, which eliminates and/or reduces undesirable space harmonics in the stator magnetomotive force. The proposed configuration improves power/torque density and efficiency with a reduction in eddy-current losses in the rotor permanent magnets and copper losses in end windings. To improve drive train availability for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), this paper proposes the design of a six-phase PM machine as two independent three-phase windings. A number of possible phase shifts between two sets of three-phase windings due to their slot-pole combination and winding configuration are investigated, and the optimum phase shift is selected by analyzing the harmonic distributions and their effect on machine performance, including the rotor eddy-current losses. The machine design is optimized for a given set of specifications for EVs, under electrical, thermal and volumetric constraints, and demonstrated by the experimental measurements on a prototype machine.
5	0	72	Medical 	 Addiction  	 digital technology; internet; adolescents; identity; cyberspace; online personas; role playing        	The main aim of this study was to understand how adolescents express their identities in virtual worlds. Fifty-nine South African high school learners (females = 51%) completed an interview and survey regarding their online interactions important for their personal identities. The adolescents completed think aloud interviews (verbalisations) and surveys which focussed on behaviour, beliefs, attitudes, opinions, feelings, expectations, self-classification, and level of involvement with social media. The data were thematically analysed and profiled by theme utilising frequency distributions. The results suggest adolescents to try out' new identities; including assumed and idealised identities. They self-report to do and say things online that they ordinarily would not do offline for social desirability reasons. Adolescents appear to inhabit two reality worlds important for the enactment of the identities they construct with online friends and strangers.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 MR Imaging; Tumor lesion segmentation; Texture features; Regularized winnow; Skippy greedy snake        	Automatic detection of brain tumors in single-spectral magnetic resonance images is a challenging task. Existing techniques suffer from inadequate performance, dependence on initial assumptions, and, sometimes, the need for manual interference. The research reported in this paper seeks to reduce some of these shortcomings, and to remove others, achieving satisfactory performance at reasonable computational costs. The success of the system described here is explained by the synergy of the following aspects: (1) a broad choice of high-level features to characterize the image's texture, (2) an efficient mechanism to eliminate less useful features (3) a machine-learning technique to induce a classifier that signals the presence of a tumor-affected tissue, and (4) an improved version of the skippy greedy snake algorithm to outline the tumor's contours. The paper describes the system and reports experiments with synthetic as well as real data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 foreign direct investment; authoritarian politics; coups; political risk        	Why do foreign investors invest in authoritarian regimes despite higher political risks? In this paper, I evaluate the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI), coups, and political risk. I develop a formal model of leadership dynamics in authoritarian regimes and examine how the initial investment decision by foreign investors is affected by expected likelihood of coups. Using the formal model, I discriminate between diverging predictions made by the greed and patronage models of authoritarian regime dynamics. Accounting for both the greed and patronage mechanisms, I demonstrate that patronage effects predominate and that increasing FDI reduces the risk of a coup. Investors are more likely to send larger FDI amounts to authoritarian states when coup risk is high to increase the likelihood of a peaceful patronage equilibrium. Using a large-n test, I find that FDI reduces the likelihood of coups, while higher coup risk is associated with increased FDI in less mobile sectors.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Capacity-building/development; COECSA; Health links; Human resource for eye health; Partnership; Royal College of Ophthalmologists; VISION 2020 LINKS        	Background: There is an extreme health workforce shortage in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. Shortage of eye care workers impedes effective implementation of prevention of blindness programs. The World Health Organization has identified education, partnership, leadership, financing, and policy as intertwined interventions that are critical to resolving this crisis on the long term. Case presentation: The VISION 2020 LINK between the College of Ophthalmology of Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in the United Kingdom aims to increase the quantity and quality of eye care training in East, Central, and Southern Africa through a focus on five strategic areas: fellowship examination for ophthalmologists, training the trainers, curriculum development for residents in ophthalmology and ophthalmic clinical officers, continuous professional development (CPD), and mentoring program for young ophthalmologists. This study examined how education and partnership can be linked to improve eye care, through an evaluation of this north-south link based on its own targets and established frameworks to guide north-south links. Methods: An exploratory qualitative case study design was used. Twenty-nine link representatives were recruited through purposive sampling and snowballing. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview schedule that incorporated the components of a successful link from an existing framework. Documents pertaining to the link were also examined. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. Results: The findings revealed that the perception to the contribution of the link to eye care in the region is generally positive. Process indicators showed that the targets in three strategic objectives of the link have been achieved. Framework-based evaluation also showed that the link is successful. Mutual learning and development of friendships were the most commonly identified success factors. Inadequate awareness of the link by college members is a key challenge. Conclusion: The study concludes that the link is active and evolving and has achieved most of its targets. Further developments should be directed to influence health system strengthening in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa more strategically. The study recommends expansion of the scope of collaboration to involve multiple health system building blocks.
3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 Disassembly Sequence Plan; Computer Aided Design; Interference Analysis; Optimization; Ant Colony algorithm; Maintenance        	"In recent years, more and more research has been conducted in close collaboration with manufacturers to design robust and profitable dismantling systems. Thus, engineers and designers of new products have to consider constraints and disassembly specifications during the design phase of products not only in the context of the end of life but more precisely in the product life cycle. Consequently, optimization of disassembly process of complex products is essential in the case of preventive maintenance. In Fact, Disassembly Sequence Plan (DSP), which is among the combinatorial problems with hard constraints in practical engineering, becomes an NP-hard problem. In this research work, an automated DSP process based on a metaheuristic method named ""Ant Colony Optimization"" is developed. Beginning with a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model, a collision analysis is performed to identify all possible interferences during the components' motion and then an interference matrix is generated to identify dynamically the disassembly parts and to ensure the feasibility of disassembly operations. The novelty of the developed approach is presented in the introduction of new criteria such as the maintainability of the usury component with several other criteria as volume, tools change and disassembly directions change. Finally, to highlight the performance of the developed approach, an implemented tool is developed and an industrial case is studied. The obtained results prove the satisfactory side of these criteria to identify a feasible DSP in a record time."
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Specific conductivity; Macroinvertebrates; Extirpation concentration values; Species sensitivity distributions; Hun-Tai River Basin        	Ionic mixtures, measured as specific conductivity, have been increasingly concerned because of their toxicities to aquatic organisms. However, identifying protective values of specific conductivity for aquatic organisms is challenging given that laboratory test systems cannot examine more salt-intolerant species nor effects occurring in streams. Large data sets used for deriving field-based benchmarks are rarely available. In this study, a field-based method for small data sets was used to derive specific conductivity benchmark, which is expected to prevent the extirpation of 95% of local taxa from circum-neutral to alkaline waters dominated by a mixture of SO42- and HCO3- anions and other dissolved ions. To compensate for the smaller sample size, species level analyses were combined with genus level analyses. The benchmark is based on extirpation concentration (XC95) values of specific conductivity for 60 macroinvertebrate genera estimated from 296 sampling sites in the Hun-Tai River Basin. We derived the specific conductivity benchmark by using a 2-point interpolation method, which yielded the benchmark of 249 mu S/cm. Our study tailored the method that was developed by USEPA to derive aquatic life benchmark for specific conductivity for basin scale application, and may provide useful information for water pollution control and management.

2	9	42	Psychology  	 Seasonal affective disorder  	 delayed sleep; depression; circadian misalignment        	Study Objective: To examine the prevalence of circadian misalignment in clinically diagnosed delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) and to compare mood and daytime functioning in those with and without a circadian basis for the disorder. Methods: One hundred and eighty-two DSPD patients aged 16-64 years, engaged in regular employment or school, underwent sleep-wake monitoring in the home, followed by a sleep laboratory visit for assessment of salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). Based on the DLMO assessments, patients were classified into two groups: circadian DSPD, defined as DLMO occurring at or after desired bedtime (DBT), or non-circadian DSPD, defined as DLMO occurring before DBT. Results: One hundred and three patients (57%) were classified as circadian DSPD and 79 (43%) as non-circadian DSPD. DLMO occurred 1.66 hours later in circadian DSPD compared to non-circadian DSPD (p <.001). Moderate-severe depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-II) were more prevalent in circadian DSPD (14.0%) than in non-circadian DSPD (3.8%; p <.05). Relative to non-circadian DSPD patients, circadian DSPD patients had 4.31 times increased odds of at least mild depressive symptoms (95% CI 1.75 to 10.64; p <.01). No group differences were found for daytime sleepiness or function, but DSPD symptoms were rated by clinicians to be more severe in those with circadian DSPD. Conclusions: Almost half of patients clinically diagnosed with DSPD did not show misalignment between the circadian pacemaker and the DBT, suggesting that the reported difficulties initiating sleep at the DBT are unlikely to be explained by the (mis) timing of the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. Circadian misalignment in DSPD is associated with increased depressive symptoms and DSPD symptom severity.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Orofacial clefts; Corticosteroids; Meta-analysis        	The aim was to evaluate the relationship between maternal corticosteroid use during first trimester of pregnancy and risk of orofacial clefts (OC). The overall findings showed a certain association between maternal corticosteroid use and occurrence of OC, compared with non-users (OR= 1.16 [95% CI: 1.01-1.33]). When study type was considered this association was significant only for case-control studies (OR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.02-1.47]), and not for cohort studies (OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 0.88-1.34]) when there are many confounders (dose, route of application, disease etc.) and biases (re-call, loss-to followup etc.) that still need to be considered. A subgroup analysis based on the type of OC gave an overall OR of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.14-1.74) in the case-control studies for cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.80-1.48) for cleft palate only (CPO), when comparing maternal corticosteroid users with non-users. However, for cohort studies, the overall OR for CL/P is 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82-1.37) and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.83-1.75) for CPO. The absolute risk of facial cleft after prenatal exposure to corticosteroids, if any, is small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
5	12	84	Medical 	 Children's Health  	 Passive smoking; parent; prevention; abstain from        	"Introduction: In this study, we aimed to determine why parents who applied to the ""well-baby clinic"" of a university hospital in Ankara do not abstain from smoking around their children. Methods: Data of this descriptive study was collected between November 11, 2013 and March 30, 2014. One hundred and fifteen volunteer participants who are either mothers or fathers of the children under five years of age participated in the study. Results: Among a total of 115 parents participated in the study 53.6 % of the participants were fathers and 46.1% of them were mothers. Nearly half (49.6 %) of the participants stated that they had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and 37.4% of them were current smokers. Nobody had smoked in 75.7% of the participants' houses. Smoking was not prohibited in the balconies in 32.1% of the houses. The most frequent two reasons why the participants do not abstain from smoking around their children were lack of information (34.7%) and addiction (24.6%). Conclusion: The major passive smoking source at home is the parents' smoking behavior. Prevention of this unhealthy behavior is crucial for children's health. Long-term studies in cross-sectional and qualitative designs clarifying the dynamics which determine parents' abstaining behavior from smoking around their kids are needed."
5	41	113	Medical 	 Overactive Bladder  	 Organ Size; Prostatic Hyperplasia; Therapeutics; Tolterodine Tartrate        	Background: The medium-to-long-term use of antimuscarinics alone or in combination with an a-blocker in men with an enlarged prostate is still controversial. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of medium-to-long-term use of tolterodine extended release (ER) with or without tamsulosin in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and larger prostate size. Methods: Totally, 152 patients (age >= 50 years) with BPH, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) >= 12, quality-of-life (QoL) score >= 3, and total prostate volume >= 25 ml were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized into four groups (n = 38 in each) to receive tolterodine ER placebo plus tamsulosin placebo, 0.2 mg tamsulosin plus tolterodine ER placebo, 4 mg tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin placebo, or tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin once daily for 24 weeks. IPSS (total, storage, and voiding subscales), QoL, maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)), and postvoid residual volume (PVR) were collected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Results: Compared with placebo, tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin significantly improved total IPSS (-7.15, -12.20, and -14.66 vs. -3.51, -5.78, and -7.23), storage IPSS (-3.56, -5.63, and -6.66 vs. -1.52, -1.21, and -2.43), voiding IPSS (-2.88, -5.10, and -6.48 vs. -1.52, -3.03, and -2.97), QoL (-1.21, -2.40, and -3.21 vs. -0.39, -1.41, and -1.60), Q(max) (2.21, 7.97, and 9.72 ml/s vs. 2.15, 2.44, and 2.73 ml/s), and PVR (-17.88, -26.97, and -27.89 ml vs. -12.03, -11.16, and -16.73 ml) at weeks 4, 12, and 24, respectively; the differences were all statistically significant (P0.05). However, a gradual increase in PVR (10.03, 10.41, and 12.89 ml) and more urinary AEs suggestive of urinary retention (11/38 vs. 4/38) were observed. Conclusion: Medium-to-long-term use of tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin should be recommended in patients with BPH and an enlarged prostate volume.
3	8	60	MAE 	 Strength of materials  	 steel tube columns filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete; eccentric compression; mechanical property; bearing capacity; regression analysis        	In order to study the mechanical properties of steel tubular columns filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete (STSRHC) under eccentric compression, this paper establishes the formula of bearing capacity, analyzes the effect of eccentricity, slenderness ratio, strength of materials and other factors on the bending column's mechanical properties by the finite element analysis software. Then, we will establish the bearing capacity formula through the regression analysis of data. The results reveal that the calculation results based on software agree well with the experimental data; eccentricity and slenderness ratio have large influence on the mechanical properties of eccentric compression members, strength of materials and shape of steel section have small impact on it; the calculation results based on the formula for the bearing capacity of eccentric compression agree well with the experimental results. The conclusions possess certain instructional significance for the design of new columns.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 Marital violence; Husband violence; Antisocial personality; Narcissistic personality; Borderline personality        	The general assumption has been that male batterers from clinical samples were mostly insecurely attached as compared to non-batterers. Recently, a large group was found (39.4 % of batterers in a clinical sample) whose main attachment style was secure. No previous studies have examined specifically the securely attached batterer. The aim of the present study was to test whether antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), but not borderline personality disorder (BPD), traits may be related to battering among securely attached individuals. Twenty-seven securely attached batterers, 45 insecurely attached batterers, 40 securely attached controls, and 22 insecurely attached controls who lived in the Netherlands, filled in self-report measures of personality disorder traits (i.e., antisocial, narcissism, borderline) and attachment (i.e., avoidant and anxious). Results showed that ASPD traits explained 19 % of the variance of battering in securely attached individuals. NPD and BPD traits are related to battering among securely attached individuals when NPD and BPD traits were entered alone in the equation.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Longitudinal train dynamics; draft gear and buffer; air brake; locomotive and wagon dumper; modelling and simulation; computing methods        	This paper discusses the evolution of longitudinal train dynamics (LTD) simulations, which covers numerical solvers, vehicle connection systems, air brake systems, wagon dumper systems and locomotives, resistance forces and gravitational components, vehicle in-train instabilities, and computing schemes. A number of potential research topics are suggested, such as modelling of friction, polymer, and transition characteristics for vehicle connection simulations, studies of wagon dumping operations, proper modelling of vehicle in-train instabilities, and computing schemes for LTD simulations. Evidence shows that LTD simulations have evolved with computing capabilities. Currently, advanced component models that directly describe the working principles of the operation of air brake systems, vehicle connection systems, and traction systems are available. Parallel computing is a good solution to combine and simulate all these advanced models. Parallel computing can also be used to conduct three-dimensional long train dynamics simulations.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 Suspension bridges; Cable; Failure; Residual strength; Corrosion        	A new methodology to determine the safety of suspension bridge main cables is proposed in this paper and illustrated by simulating the failure of a corrosion-deteriorated cable composed of 9,061 wires. The approach is the first to use a finite-element (FE) model to predict the failure load, account for load recovery due to friction in broken wires, and simulate the reduced strength of the cable as a three-dimensional random field. To obtain cable failure load, the load is increased gradually, causing individual wires break according to their residual strength variability. Because of the load transfer to surrounding wires, the breakage of an individual wire affects the stress state of its surrounding wires. Consequently, as the load is increased, this local damage spreads to its immediate vicinity, and eventually the entire cable fails. Because of the complexity of the problem, the critical failure load is determined through a Monte Carlo simulation approach that accounts for the uncertainty in the spatial variability of the residual strength of the individual wires. The probability distribution of the load that will drive a suspension bridge cable to failure is reported and investigated in the paper. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 active learning; causal learning; intervention; resource rationality; theory change        	Higher-level cognition depends on the ability to learn models of the world. We can characterize this at the computational level as a structure-learning problem with the goal of best identifying the prevailing causal relationships among a set of relata. However, the computational cost of performing exact Bayesian inference over causal models grows rapidly as the number of relata increases. This implies that the cognitive processes underlying causal learning must be substantially approximate. A powerful class of approximations that focuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the Neurath's ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast as a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people's limited willingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by the ground truth they hope to approach. Inspired by this metaphor and by algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference in machine learning, we propose an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning under which learners represent only a single global hypothesis that they update locally as they gather evidence. We propose a related scheme for understanding how, under these limitations, learners choose informative interventions that manipulate the causal system to help elucidate its workings. We find support for our approach in the analysis of 3 experiments.
1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 Dead time; SOPDT; PID controller structures; Derivative filter; Filter coefficient        	The proportional-integral-derivative controllers are being used by process industry to control various complex industrial processes, due to their simplicity and easy implementation. There are various structures of PID controllers available in the literature which makes it difficult to decide the selection of suitable controller structure for a particular industrial process model. This complexity further increases in case of structures with derivative filters. It is a matter of investigation to evaluate the effect of varying the filter coefficient on controller performance for such PID controller structures. The present analysis lay emphasis on the set-point tracking capability of the controller by weighting the filter coefficients of these structures.
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 cascade; low-cost; standing-wave; thermoacoustic engine; travelling-wave        	The design, construction, and experimental evaluation of a cascade thermoacoustic engine are presented in this paper. The system was designed and built under the constraint of an inexpensive device to meet the energy needs of the people based in remote and rural areas. From the cost and straightforward system point of view, the air at atmospheric pressure was applied as a working fluid, and the main resonator tubes were then constructed of conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes. Such device consists of one standing-wave unit and one traveling-wave unit connected in series. This topology is preferred because the traveling-wave unit provides an efficient energy conversion, and a straight-line series configuration is easy to build and allows no Gedeon streaming. The system was designed to operate at a low frequency of about 57 Hz. The measured results were in a reasonably good agreement with the predicted results. So far, this system can deliver up to 61W of acoustic power, which was about 17% of the Carnot efficiency. In the further step, the proposed device will be applied as the prime mover for driving the thermoacoustic refrigerator.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 Bioengineering; Issue 120; Optogenetics; microbiology; synthetic biology; chemostat; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; budding yeast; control; system identification; protein expression        	Optogenetic systems utilize genetically-encoded proteins that change conformation in response to specific wavelengths of light to alter cellular processes. There is a need for culturing and measuring systems that incorporate programmed illumination and stimulation of optogenetic systems. We present a protocol for building and using a continuous culturing apparatus to illuminate microbial cells with programmed doses of light, and automatically acquire and analyze images of cells in the effluent. The operation of this apparatus as a chemostat allows the growth rate and the cellular environment to be tightly controlled. The effluent of the continuous cell culture is regularly sampled and the cells are imaged by multi-channel microscopy. The culturing, sampling, imaging, and image analysis are fully automated so that dynamic responses in the fluorescence intensity and cellular morphology of cells sampled from the culture effluent are measured over multiple days without user input. We demonstrate the utility of this culturing apparatus by dynamically inducing protein production in a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae engineered with an optogenetic system that activates transcription.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Migration; Invasion; Glioma; 14-3-3-beta; YWHAB        	Purpose: To assess the influence of 14-3-3-beta in modulating the migration and invasion of human glioma cells. Methods: To profile the genes associated with malignant glioma cell motility, differential display-polymerase chain reaction was performed and the findings were validated by Northern blotting in the U343MG-A, U87MG, and U87MG-10' human glioma cell lines. Antisense 14-3-3-beta cDNA plasmid was transfected into U87MG ('U87-YA-3'). To follow motility changes after transfection, simple scratch test and matrigel assay were performed. Morphological and cytoskeletal changes were documented by light and confocal microscopy. In addition, doubling times of the transfectant and endogenous 14-3-3-beta levels were determined in various glioma cell lines with different motilities. Results: 14-3-3-beta was highly expressed in U87MG cells. U87-YA-3 cells became small and flat, and actin was depolarized. Furthermore, U87-YA-3 cell motility was inhibited markedly versus parental U87MG cells. The doubling times of transfected and parent cells were 32 and 37 hours, respectively. Endogenous 14-3-3-beta expression in the human glioma cell lines was proportional to their migratory and invasive abilities. Conclusion: 14-3-3-beta modulates the migration and invasion in U87MG cells, which may be useful in developing therapeutic approaches for the treatment of glioma.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Acute-phase protein; biomarker; causality; chronic inflammation; Mendelian randomization        	This review summarizes present evidence for the role of YKL-40 in the diagnosis, prognosis and cause of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. The question of whether YKL-40 is merely a marker or a causal factor in the development of cardiovascular and liver disease is addressed, with emphasis on the Mendelian randomization design. The Mendelian randomization approach uses genetic variants associated with lifelong high plasma YKL-40 levels that are largely unconfounded and not prone to reverse causation. Thus, the approach mimics a controlled double-blind randomized trial, but it uses genetic variants rather than a drug and placebo, and like a blinded trial, it allows inference about causality. Moreover, the review also covers background on the molecular biology and functions of YKL-40, YKL-40 levels in healthy individuals and reference range, and the role of YKL-40 as a biomarker of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease. YKL-40 is a plasma protein named after its three N-terminal amino acids, Y (tyrosine), K (lysine) and L (leucine), and its molecular weight of 40kDa. It is produced by local inflammatory cells in inflamed tissues, such as lipid-laden macrophages inside the vessel wall and perhaps also hepatic stellate cells. Observational studies show that plasma YKL-40 levels are elevated in patients with cardiovascular and liver disease and are associated with disease severity and prognosis. Furthermore, elevated plasma YKL-40 levels in apparently healthy individuals are associated with a 2-fold increased risk of future ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism, but not with myocardial infarction, suggesting that YKL-40 could play a role in the formation of embolisms rather than atherosclerosis per se. Further, elevated YKL-40 levels combined with excessive alcohol consumption are associated with 10-years risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis of up to 7%, suggesting that YKL-40 can be used as a strong noninvasive marker of predicting alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Importantly, in Mendelian randomization studies, genetically elevated plasma YKL-40 levels were not associated with risk of cardiovascular and alcoholic liver disease, thus suggesting that plasma YKL-40 does not play a causal role in the development of these diseases. Despite this, plasma YKL-40 levels may play a role in disease progression after diagnosis, and inhibition of YKL-40 activity might be a novel therapy in some cardiovascular and liver diseases.
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 CERN LHC; ATLAS; Database; Metadata; Conditions; Oracle; Hadoop        	"The ATLAS experiment used for many years a large database infrastructure based on Oracle to store several different types of non-event data: time-dependent detector configuration and conditions data, calibrations and alignments, configurations of Grid sites, catalogues for data management tools, job records for distributed workload management tools, run and event metadata. The rapid development of ""NoSQL"" databases (structured storage services) in the last five years allowed an extended and complementary usage of traditional relational databases and new structured storage tools in order to improve the performance of existing applications and to extend their functionalities using the possibilities offered by the modern storage systems. The trend is towards using the best tool for each kind of data, separating for example the intrinsically relational metadata from payload storage, and records that are frequently updated and benefit from transactions from archived information. Access to all components has to be orchestrated by specialised services that run on front-end machines and shield the user from the complexity of data storage infrastructure. This paper describes this technology evolution in the ATLAS database infrastructure and presents a few examples of large database applications that benefit from it."
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Network Intrusion; Rough Set Theory; Machine Learning; SVM        	Data mining for intrusion detection is one of the most cutting-edge researches which focus on network security, database, and information decision-making. Due to the emergence of new forms of attacks and intrusion on the network, we need a new intrusion detection system which would be able to detect new and unknown attacks. Nevertheless, because of the complexity and diversity of network security alarm data, ordinarily, it is difficult to analyze and evaluate network security situation accurately. Intrusion detection is to protect network system from attacks and defend its security. We used machine learning technology in intrusion detection system in order to improve system performance effectively. In the paper, by studying the characteristics of network data intrusion, we put forward a intrusion detection system based on Rough set theory, and detect anomaly action in network. This method can extract detection rule model of network connection data, dealing with incomplete data and discrete data exit in data mining effectively. The basic ideas and techniques of data mining-based intrusion detection and the architecture of a real time data mining-based IDS are discussed. Meanwhile, we mainly analyzed the basic structure of intrusion detection system and application of several Machine Learning methods in intrusion detection which include Bayesian Classification-based method, neural networks-based method, Support Vector Machine-based method(SVM). The experiments results show that, models, methods and generation framework proposed in this paper can effectively detect network intrusion.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 genistein; endothelial cells; gene expression; blood pressure; angiogenesis        	Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that the dietary isoflavone genistein (Gen) has beneficial effects with regard to cardiovascular disease and in particular on aspects related to blood pressure and angiogenesis. The biological action of Gen may be, at Least in part, attributed to its ability to affect cell signalling and response. However, so far, most of the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of Gen in the endothelium are unknown. Methods and results: To examine the transcriptional response to 2.5 mu M Gen on primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC), we applied cDNA array technology both under baseline condition and after treatment with the pro-atherogenic stimulus, copper-oxidized LDL. The alteration of the expression patterns of individual transcripts was substantiated using either RT-PCR or Northern blotting. Gen significantly affected the expression of genes encoding for proteins centrally involved in the vascular tone such as endothelin-converting enzyme-1, endothetin-2, estrogen related receptor a and atria[ natriuretic peptide receptor A precursor. Furthermore, Gen countered the effect of oxLDL on mRNA levels encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 165, types 1 and 2. Conclusions: Our data indicate that physiologically achievable levels of Gen change the expression of mRNA encoding for proteins involved in the control of blood pressure under baseline conditions and reduce the angiogenic response to oxLDL in the endothelium.

3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 Particle removal; invasive species; Mixed-cell raceway        	We compared the hydrodynamics of replicate experimental mixed cell and replicate standard Burrows pond rearing systems at the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, ID, in an effort to identify methods for improved solids removal. We measured and compared the hydraulic residence time, particle removal efficiency, and measures of velocity using several tools. Computational fluid dynamics was used first to characterize hydraulics in the proposed retrofit that included removal of the traditional Burrows pond dividing wall and establishment of four counter rotating cells with appropriate drains and inlet water jets. Hydraulic residence time was subsequently established in the four full scale test tanks using measures of conductivity of a salt tracer introduced into the systems both with and without fish present. Vertical and horizontal velocities were also measured with acoustic Doppler velocimetry in transects across each of the rearing systems. Finally, we introduced ABS sinking beads that simulated fish solids then followed the kinetics of their removal via the drains to establish relative purge rates. The mixed cell raceway provided higher mean velocities and a more uniform velocity distribution than did the Burrows pond. Vectors revealed well-defined, counter-rotating cells in the mixed cell raceway, and were likely contributing factors in achieving a relatively high particle removal efficiency-88.6% versus 8.0% during the test period. We speculate retrofits of rearing ponds to mixed cell systems will improve both the rearing environments for the fish and solids removal, improving the efficiency and bio-security of fish culture. We recommend further testing in hatchery production trials to evaluate fish physiology and growth. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.
2	9	42	Psychology  	 Seasonal affective disorder  	 Seasonal affective disorder; Sunlight exposure; Depression; Elderly        	Seasonal affective disorder is becoming more widely recognised as a prevalent mood disorder in the adult population. However, few studies have investigated the link between sunlight exposure and mood in the elderly. Referrals to the community Mental Health Care for Older People (MHCOP) in the Hackney and City area, were screened for the number of patients referred with depression in three separate years (2007, 2009 and 2011) in order to determine whether more referrals were made to the service during darker months of the year (October to March) than in the lighter months of the year (April to September). When data from the three years was combined, we found no significant increase in the number of referrals to the MHCOP in the darker months (Chi squared value 1.375, p value (2 tailed) 0.2409). We observed no statistically significant seasonal pattern of referrals, this suggests that depression in older people is not more prevalent in darker months of the year.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Depressive symptoms; fatigue; lung cancer; quality of life; sleep-wake rhythm; sleep quality        	Studies on the diurnal sleep-wake rhythm of patients with lung cancer have mostly examined patients cross-sectionally, whereas the effects of lung cancer treatment over time have rarely been considered. Through long-term longitudinal tracking of patients with lung cancer, this study examined changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep quality, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue and quality of life (QoL) at various treatment stages. In addition, factors affecting their QoL were explored. Hierarchical linear modeling was adopted to analyze a convenience sample of 82 patients with lung cancer. The changes in their sleep-wake rhythm, sleep, mood (anxiety, depressive symptoms and fatigue) and QoL were observed at five time points: prior to treatment and at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48 after the start of the treatment. The effects of sex, age, cancer stage, treatment type, comorbidities and time were controlled to determine the predictors of patients' QoL. The results showed that patients' sleep-wake rhythms were poor before treatments. Compared with baseline, the sleep-wake rhythms of the patients significantly improved at week 48, and anxiety significantly improved at weeks 6, 12, 24 and 48. By contrast, their fatigue became exacerbated at weeks 8 and 48. Moreover, QoL improved significantly from week 6 until the end of the treatment period. QoL was negatively affected by poor sleep quality (beta = -0.69, p = 0.00) and depressive symptoms (beta = -2.59, p < 0.001) and positively affected by regular sleep-wake rhythms (beta = 0.23, p = 0.001). Therefore, clinical health-care professionals should focus more attention to the fatigue levels of patients with lung cancer before, during and after treatment. Health-care professionals may also need to provide such patients with health education regarding sleep hygiene and with emotional support to assist them in maintaining regular sleep-wake rhythms in order to improve their QoL.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Population genetics; Fluctuating population sizes; Dynamical system; Stochastic process        	Standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population size has important limitations. An alternative model that allows independently fluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is reviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral at the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations nevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a separation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of a fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuation-induced selection dynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the incompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed population size.
6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 wound healing; dressing; diabetic; matrix; biomaterial        	Progress in biomaterial science and engineering and increasing knowledge in cell biology have enabled us to develop functional biomaterials providing appropriate biochemical and biophysical cues for tissue regeneration applications. Tissue regeneration is particularly important to treat chronic wounds of people with diabetes. Understanding and controlling the cellular microenvironment of the wound tissue are important to improve the wound healing process. In this study, we review different biochemical (e.g., growth factors, peptides, DNA, and RNA) and biophysical (e.g., topographical guidance, pressure, electrical stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic field) cues providing a functional and instructive acellular matrix to heal diabetic chronic wounds. The biochemical and biophysical signals generally regulate cell-matrix interactions and cell behavior and function inducing the tissue regeneration for chronic wounds. Some technologies and devices have already been developed and used in the clinic employing biochemical and biophysical cues for wound healing applications. These technologies can be integrated with smart biomaterials to deliver therapeutic agents to the wound tissue in a precise and controllable manner. This review provides useful guidance in understanding molecular mechanisms and signals in the healing of diabetic chronic wounds and in designing instructive biomaterials to treat them.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 Breast cancer; hypothyroidism; hyperthyroidism; thyroid antibodies        	Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between thyroid function abnormalities and breast cancer and, in particular, the prognostic markers of breast cancer.. Subjects and methods: Baseline levels of thyrotropin, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine and thyroid autoantibodies were measured in 97 women with primary breast cancer, 27 women with benign breast disease, and 4 women with atypical ductal hyperplasia. Their baseline levels were compared with those in 48 healthy women with a normal mammography in the last 2 years. Results: There were no significant associations between history of thyroid disease and breast cancer (p = 0.33). The mean baseline levels of triiodothyronine and thyrotropin did not differ significantly between the compared groups. The mean baseline levels of free thyroxine were found to be significantly higher in the breast cancer group, even after adjusting for thyroid replacement therapy. The presence of thyroid antibodies did not differ significantly between the compared groups. In a subgroup analysis, breast cancer cases with thyroid disease and particularly hypothyroidism had a significantly lower incidence of lymph node metastases compared with breast cancer cases without thyroid disease. Conclusions: Our data confirmed the proliferative effect of thyroid hormones on breast cells, which had previously been shown in vitro. Additionally, thyroid disease and particularly hypothyroid function appeared to be associated with a lower incidence of lymph node metastases. Further studies to determine the prognostic role of thyroid hormones in breast cancer are warranted.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Operational amplifier; Transfer function; Frequency compensation; Current buffer; Poles; Zeroes        	This paper describes conditions and simple circuit modifications that eliminate undesired complex conjugate poles in two-stage operational amplifiers that are based on current buffer Miller compensation. The complex conjugate poles have been the main problem of this frequency compensation topology since its first introduction more than 30 years ago. It is shown that a resistor added between the second stage and the amplifier output creates a zero that improves stability and reduces the circuit to a second-order system. This greatly simplifies the design of an otherwise complex topology and at the same time retains the valued benefits of current buffer based frequency compensation. In addition, for the case where a short channel transistor is used for the current buffer, conditions that create sufficient phase margin for the inner loop of the amplifier without the nulling resistor are formulated.
2	3	36	Psychology  	 Nonverbal communication  	 Patient-physician communication; Racially discordant medical interactions; Implicit racial bias; Coding systems; Nonverbal/paraverbal behaviors        	Physician implicit racial bias has been found to predict racial minority patients' reports of satisfaction and trust immediately after engaging in racially discordant medical interactions. This suggests physician implicit racial bias is somehow manifested in physician communication behaviors and noticed by patients during the medical interactions. However, it is unclear exactly how physician implicit racial bias manifests behaviorally during racially discordant medical interactions. The authors argue that such lack of understanding might be due to several limitations with the existing patient-physician coding systems. In order to further advance research on patient-physician communication during racially discordant medical interactions, new coding systems tailored for racially discordant medical interactions are required. Specifically, it is suggested that these coding systems need to be capable of assessing physician nonverbal/paraverbal communication behaviors that were found to be positive or negative by racial minority patients themselves. This likely requires innovative research approaches, such as a mixed-methods approach.
5	22	94	Medical 	 Healthy Sleep  	 Snoring; Guideline; Adults        	Due to the frequency of this phenomenon and the often considerable distress caused to the affected person, competent advice, diagnosis and treatment of snoring in adults is of particular importance. The aim of this guideline is to promote high-quality medical care for patients affected by this problem. According to the three-level concept of the AWMF, it corresponds to an S1 guideline. Prior to any therapeutic intervention, relevant sleep medical history, clinical examination, as well as a mandatory objective diagnostic measure are performed. Snoring is only treated if the patient asks for it. In general, invasive methods should be viewed critically and the patient should be advised correspondingly. In the case of surgical therapy, minimally invasive techniques are preferred. Reducing body weight (in the case of overweight snorers), abstinence from alcohol, nicotine and sleep medication, as well as maintaining a healthy sleep-wake cycle can be recommended from a sleep-medicine perspective, although convincing clinical studies are not yet available. Since evidence for the effectiveness of muscle stimulation or various methods for toning and training of the muscles of the floor of mouth is not available, these methods are not recommended. Snoring can be successfully treated with the use of an intraoral device; however, careful patient selection is important. Avoiding a supine position during sleep can be helpful in some cases. Only limited data is available on the success rates of the surgical approaches and long term data is often lacking, and not all techniques have been sufficiently evaluated from a scientific point of view. Nasal surgery is only indicated if the patient suffers from nasal obstruction. Extensive data supports the effectiveness of laser-assisted resection of excessive soft palate tissue (laser-assisted uvuloplasty, LAUP). In principle, however, such resections can be performed using other techniques. Placebo-controlled studies were able to prove the effectiveness of radiofrequency surgery of the soft palate. A reduction in snoring could also be achieved in many cases by means of soft palate implants with minimal post-operative morbidity. The indication for tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty should be made cautiously due to the comparatively high morbidity associated with these procedures.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 Diffusion sign subband adaptive filtering algorithm; Individual weighting factor; Proportionate adaptive filtering algorithm; Impulsive interference        	A new diffusion sign subband adaptive filtering algorithm with an individual weighting factor (IWF-DSSAF) for each subband is proposed for distributed estimation in the impulsive noise environment. Since the inherent decorrelating property of subband adaptive filtering is fully used, the proposed algorithm obtains better performance in terms of convergence rate and tracking capability as compared with the diffusion sign subband adaptive filtering (DSSAF) algorithm. In addition, the stability analysis of the IWF-DSSAF algorithm is performed based on Price's theorem. After that, in order to obtain a faster convergence rate in sparse distributed system identification, the improved proportionate IWF-DSSAF algorithm is proposed, in which a gain distribution matrix is incorporated into the IWF-DSSAF algorithm. Finally, simulations are carried out in the distributed system identification context. The results of simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve better convergence performance than their counterparts.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 Voxel-based morphometry (VBM); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Incarcerated adolescents; Pattern classifier; Support vector machine (SVM); Gray matter volume        	Background: Violence that leads to homicide results in an extreme financial and emotional burden on society. Juveniles who commit homicide are often tried in adult court and typically spend the majority of their lives in prison. Despite the enormous costs associated with homicidal behavior, there have been no serious neuroscientific studies examining youth who commit homicide. Methods: Here we use neuroimaging and voxel-based morphometry to examine brain gray matter in incarcerated male adolescents who committed homicide (n = 20) compared with incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide (n = 135). Two additional control groups were used to understand further the nature of gray matter differences: incarcerated offenders who did not commit homicide matched on important demographic and psychometric variables (n = 20) and healthy participants from the community (n = 21). Results: Compared with incarcerated adolescents who did not commit homicide (n = 135), incarcerated homicide offenders had reduced gray matter volumes in the medial and lateral temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and posterior insula. Feature selection and support vector machine learning classified offenders into the homicide and non-homicide groups with 81% overall accuracy. Conclusions: Our results indicate that brain structural differences may help identify those at the highest risk for committing serious violent offenses. (C) 2014 The Authors.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Genome-wide enhancer profiling; Sex determination; Sertoli cell development; Mouse        	A current goal of molecular biology is to identify transcriptional networks that regulate cell differentiation. However, identifying functional gene regulatory elements has been challenging in the context of developing tissues where material is limited and cell types are mixed. To identify regulatory sites during sex determination, we subjected Sertoli cells from mouse fetal testes to DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac. DNaseI-seq identified putative regulatory sites around genes enriched in Sertoli and pregranulosa cells; however, active enhancers marked by H3K27ac were enriched proximal to only Sertoli-enriched genes. Sequence analysis identified putative binding sites of known and novel transcription factors likely controlling Sertoli cell differentiation. As a validation of this approach, we identified a novel Sertoli cell enhancer upstream of Wt1, and used it to drive expression of a transgenic reporter in Sertoli cells. This work furthers our understanding of the complex genetic network that underlies sex determination and identifies regions that potentially harbor non-coding mutations underlying disorders of sexual development.
5	36	108	Medical 	 Multiple Sclerosis  	 Diffusion tensor imaging; multiple sclerosis; CSF; sulcal CSF; ventricular CSF; cognitive impairment        	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSECerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain can be compartmentalized into two main divisions: ventricular CSF and subarachnoid space (sulcal CSF). Changes in CSF volumetry are seen in many neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis (MS) and found to correlate with clinical outcomes. We aimed to test the relation between the volumetry of sulcal and ventricular CSF and cognitive impairment (CI) based on the minimal assessment of cognitive function in MS (MACFIMS) in patients with MS. MATERIAL AND METHODSForty-six patients with MS underwent the MACFIMS battery and classified as nonimpaired (MSNI) (n = 10) and cognitively impaired (MSCI) (n = 30) and borderline (MSBD) MS patients (n = 6). Volumes of sulcal and ventricular CSF along with global gray and white matter volumes and cortical thickness were obtained by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T1-weighted (T1w)-based segmentation. These measures were statistically analyzed for associations with CI after adjusting for the age, education in years, lesion load, and disease duration. RESULTSSulcal CSF showed the strongest correlation with CI (r = .51, P = .001) in our cohort, whereas ventricular CSF (P = .28, P = .19) along with cortical thickness and gray matter volume failed to show a significant correlation. Group analyses unadjusted for multiple comparisons showed significant difference in volumes of sulcal CSF and ventricular CSF between MSNI and MSCI groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONSulcal CSF correlates with CI in patients with MS, possibly explained by cortical atrophy. DTI/T1w-based sulcal CSF segmentation method might be used as an indirect and simple neuroimaging marker to monitor CI in MS patients.

To perform this study a network of eighty raingauges spread throughout the region has been used. Statistical parameters such as the spatial cross-correlation coefficient and the space-time cross-correlation coefficient were calculated and their evolution with separation distance studied. It is hoped that information reported could be useful in better understanding characteristics of rain and in developing countermeasures for terrestrial and satellite radio networks operating at frequencies above 10 GHz.
1	13	30	ECE 	 State space representation  	 Artificial intelligence; chaotic system; linear differential inclusion; Lyapunov method        	In this study we present a neural network (NN)-based approach to represent a nonlinear Takagi-Sugeno system. A linear differential inclusion (LDI) state-space representation is utilized to deal with the NN models. Taking advantage of the LDI representation, the stability conditions and controller design are derived for a class of nonlinear systems. The controller design is based on the fuzzy control and parallel distributed compensation scheme, which is utilized to construct a global fuzzy logic controller by blending all local state-feedback controllers. Furthermore, this control problem can be reduced to linear matrix inequality problems by the Schur Complements. Efficient interior-point algorithms are now available in the Matlab toolbox to solve this problem. A chaotic system is simulated to show the feasibility of the proposed fuzzy controller design approach.

The development of molecular barcoding for next-generation sequencing has greatly enhanced the sensitivity of detecting such mutations by massively parallel sequencing. However, further improvements in specificity would be useful for a variety of applications. We herein describe a technology (BiSeqS) that can increase the specificity of sequencing by at least two orders of magnitude over and above that achieved with molecular barcoding and can be applied to any massively parallel sequencing instrument. BiSeqS employs bisulfite treatment to distinguish the two strands of molecularly barcoded DNA; its specificity arises from the requirement for the same mutation to be identified in both strands. Because no library preparation is required, the technology permits very efficient use of the template DNA as well as sequence reads, which are nearly all confined to the amplicons of interest. Such efficiency is critical for clinical samples, such as plasma, in which only tiny amounts of DNA are often available. We show here that BiSeqS can be applied to evaluate transversions, as well as small insertions or deletions, and can reliably detect one mutation among >10,000 wild-type molecules.
0	7	7	CS 	 Parallel computing  	 Radial distribution function; Parallel computing; MPI; Statistical mechanics; Monte Carlo simulation; Stochastic approach        	In the present paper, an ultrafast and scalable parallel program for the Radial Pair Function (RPF) is presented via pure Message Passing Interface (MPI) paradigm. The parallel code computes the radial distribution function for the single-component as well as multi-component systems. The single-component and multi-component systems have been extracted for benchmarking purposes by means of user-written codes in C++ for the Graphite structure and MPI C++ for hydrogen adsorption via Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) in the Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWNT), respectively. The speedup and efficiency curves substantiate an excellent performance in terms of computing time and computation size as well. Additionally, the mentioned MPI paradigms are nearly five times (single-component systems) and two times (multi-component systems) faster than the relevant parallel codes using a machine with 48 CPUs and NVIDIA Quadro K5200/PCIe/SSE2. Some conclusions and outlooks pertaining to the numerical implementations, algorithm optimization involving the space decomposition idea have been discussed and provided.
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 freedom restriction; goal frames; avoidance; approach; reactance; self threat; change        	Two experiments examined how individuals respond to a restriction presented within an approach versus an avoidance frame. In Study 1, working on a problem-solving task, participants were initially free to choose their strategy, but for a second task were told to change their strategy. The message to change was embedded in either an approach or avoidance frame. When confronted with an avoidance compared to an approach frame, the participants' reactance toward the request was greater and, in turn, led to impaired performance. The role of reactance as a response to threat to freedom was explicitly examined in Study 2, in which participants evaluated a potential change in policy affecting their program of study herein explicitly varying whether a restriction was present or absent and whether the message was embedded in an approach versus avoidance frame. When communicated with an avoidance frame and as a restriction, participants showed the highest resistance in terms of reactance, message agreement and evaluation of the communicator. The difference in agreement with the change was mediated by reactance only when a restriction was present. Overall, avoidance goal frames were associated with more resistance to change on different levels of experience (reactance, performance, and person perception). Reactance mediated the effect of goal frame on other outcomes only when a restriction was present.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 main cable; galloping; wind tunnel test; suspension bridge; construction period        	Large amplitude oscillation of steepled main cables usually presents during construction of a long-span bridge. To study this phenomenon, six typical main cables with different cross sections during construction are investigated. Two main foci have been conducted. Firstly, aerodynamic coefficients of a main cable are obtained and compared through simulation and wind tunnel test: (1) to ensure the simulation accuracy, influences of the numerical model's grid size, and the jaggy edges of main cable's cross section on main cable's aerodynamic coefficients are investigated; (2) aerodynamic coefficients of main cables at different wind attack angles are obtained based on the wind tunnel test in which the experimental model is made by rigid plastic using the 3D Printing Technology; (3) then numerical results are compared with wind tunnel test results, and they are in good agreement. Secondly, aerodynamic coefficients of the six main cables at different wind attack angles are obtained through numerical simulation. Then Den Hartog criterion is used to analyze the transverse galloping of main cables during construction. Results show all the six main cables may undergo galloping, which may be an important reason for the large amplitude oscillation of steepled main cables during construction. The flow structures around the main cables indicate that the characteristic of the airflow trajectory over a steepled main cable may play an important role in the galloping generation Engineers should take some effective measures to control this harmful phenomenon due to the big possibility of the onset of galloping during the construction period.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Feeding practices; Migration; Obesity; Pre-school children        	Objective: Parental feeding practices shape children's relationships with food and eating. Feeding is embedded socioculturally in values and attitudes related to food and parenting. However, few studies have examined associations between parental feeding practices and migrant background. Design: Cross-sectional study. Parental feeding practices (restriction, pressure to eat, monitoring) were assessed using the Child Feeding Questionnaire. Differences were explored in four sub-samples grouped by maternal place of birth: Sweden, Nordic/Western Europe, Eastern/Southern Europe and countries outside Europe. Crude, partly and fully adjusted linear regression models were created. Potential confounding variables included child's age, gender and weight status, and mother's age, weight status, education and concern about child weight. Setting: Malmo and Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects: Mothers (n 1325, representing seventy-three countries; mean age 36.5 years; 28.1% of non-Swedish background; 30.7% with overweight/obesity; 62.8% with university education) of pre-school children (mean age 4.8 years; 50.8% boys; 18.6% with overweight/obesity). Results: Non-Swedish-born mothers, whether European-born or non-European-born, were more likely to use restriction. Swedish-born mothers and Nordic/Western European-born mothers reported lower levels of pressure to eat compared with mothers born in Eastern/Southern Europe and mothers born outside Europe. Differences in monitoring were small. Among the potential confounding variables, child weight status and concern about child weight were highly influential. Concern about child weight accounted for some of the effect of maternal origin on restriction. Conclusions: Non-European-born mothers were more concerned about children being overweight and more likely to report controlling feeding practices. Future research should examine acculturative and structural factors underlying differences in feeding.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 suspension bridge; cable-stayed bridge; initial shape; shape-finding; initial force method; elastic catenary cable element; TCUD method        	The TCUD method (Kim and Lee, 2001) can minimize undesirable lateral displacements in cable bridge structures by including the unstrained lengths of the cable members as unknowns and introducing additional constraint conditions. The axial deformations in the girder and the main tower deviating from the target configuration are, however, unavoidable when self-anchored cable bridges are considered. On the other hand, the IFM (initial force method) can be used to adjust the axial deformations to conform to the initial shape but it is critical that the unstrained lengths of the cables are accurately evaluated. In this study, improved schemes for the TCUD method and the IFM for finding the initial shape of 3 dimensional cable-supported bridges under dead load, are presented. For this purpose, the TCUD method and the initial force method are firstly reviewed. Two improved algorithms, which can overcome shortcomings of the previous initial-shaping analysis methods, are developed based on an elastic catenary cable element and a nonlinear space frame element. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed analysis algorithms are demonstrated through the numerical application to 3 dimensional initial shape problems for self-anchored suspension and cable-stayed bridges.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 psychological well-being; academic stress; coping strategies; university students; latent profile analysis        	In the transactional model of stress, coping responses are the key to preventing the stress response. In this study, the possible role of psychological well-being as a personal determinant of coping strategies in the academic context was analyzed. Specifically, the study has two objectives: (a) to identify different profiles of students according to their level of psychological well-being; and (b) to analyze the differences between these profiles in the use of three coping strategies (positive reappraisal, support seeking, and planning). Age, gender, and degree were estimated as covariables. A total of 1,072 university students participated in the study. Latent profile analysis was applied to four indices of psychological well-being: self-acceptance, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. An optimal four-profile solution, reflecting significant incremental shifts from low to very high psychological well-being, was obtained. As predicted, the profile membership distinguished between participants in positive reappraisal, support-seeking, and planning. Importantly, the higher the profile of psychological well-being was, the higher the use of the three coping strategies. Gender differences in coping strategies were observed, but no interaction effects with psychological well-being were found. Age and degree were not relevant in explaining the use of coping strategies. These results suggest that psychological well-being stands as an important personal resource to favor adaptive coping strategies for academic stress.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 home network security; traffic analysis; cyber threats        	The rapid growth of residential broadband connections and Internet-enabled home devices have driven the success of many useful applications such as video streaming and remote healthcare. However, poorly managed routers and connected devices in the home are vulnerable under persistent threats and exploitations from cyber attackers across the Internet who continuously identify, compromise, and control devices as part of botnets for launching click fraud, denial of service attacks, spam campaigns. These growing threats and broad damages have made it imperative to understand, characterize, filter, and reduce exploit traffic towards millions of home routers and billions of connected devices in the home. This paper presents a bloom-filter based analytics framework to capture persistent threats towards the same home routers and to identify correlated attacks towards distributed home networks. Our experimental results based on network traffic collected from real homes over 18 months have revealed a number of interesting findings on persistent and correlated threats towards home networks, which calls for improved security and management of home networks. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first effort to characterize cyber threats towards home networks and to propose a simple and yet effective approach to identify persistent and aggressive attacks towards home networks.

5	20	92	Medical 	 Fungal Infection  	 Sporotrichosis; Children; Sporothrix schenckii; Fungal infection; Skin fungal infections; Review        	Sporotrichosis, a disease caused by the saprophytic, dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii, is currently diagnosed worldwide, especially in some tropical and subtropical areas. The infection usually occurs after traumatic inoculation of soil, plants, and organic matter containing the fungus. Certain activities, such as floriculture, agriculture, mining, and wood exploitation, and zoonotic transmission are associated with the mycosis. In humans, the disease is limited to skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the proximal lymphatic. It occurs commonly as lymphocutaneous or fixed lesions predominantly affect the upper limbs and face, the latter location is frequent in children. However, sporotrichosis in children is uncommonly seen. Data about the disease on this specific group of patients is scanty. The gold standard for diagnosis is culture. Nevertheless, there are other recently added methods (serological, histopathological, and molecular) useful for an accurate diagnosis. Itraconazole is the first choice of treatment for sporotrichosis; however, potassiumiodide is also an effective option, mainly in children.
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 neurocognition; clinical high-risk psychosis; functioning; social skills; negative symptoms; mediation        	Objective: Neurocognition is known to impact functioning in individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for psychosis, but studies investigating potential mediators of this relationship are scarce. Building on evidence from schizophrenia spectrum disorders, the study tested whether negative symptoms and social skills act as mediators between neurocognition and functional outcome in UHR individuals. Methods: Ultrahigh risk participants (N = 84) underwent neurocognitive testing using the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. Social skills and negative symptoms were assessed using the High-Risk Social Challenge task and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms respectively. Four instruments were used to assess overall functioning, and one instrument assessed quality of life encompassing social functioning. Results: The cross-sectional analyses revealed that neurocognition was related to the measures of functioning. Negative symptoms mediated the relationship between neurocognition and four of the five measures of functioning. We did not find social skills to mediate between neurocognition and functioning. Conclusion: Negative symptoms appear to mediate the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome in UHR individuals, but the finding needs to be confirmed and extended to longitudinal studies. This underscores the importance of focusing on both neurocognition and negative symptoms when aiming at improving the functional outcome of UHR individuals.

5	20	92	Medical 	 Fungal Infection  	 RNA-Seq; plant-Pathogen interaction; gene expression; fusarium wilt; melon; molecular mechanism        	"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis Snyd. & Hans race 1.2 (FOM1.2) is the most virulent and yield-limiting pathogen of melon (Cucumis melo L.) worldwide. Current information suggest that the resistance to race 1.2 is controlled by multiple recessive genes and strongly affected by the environment. RNA-Seq analysis was used to identify candidate resistance genes and to dissect the early molecular processes deployed during melon-FOM1.2 interaction in the resistant doubled haploid line NAD and in the susceptible genotype Charentais-T (CHT) at 24 and 48h post-inoculation (hpi). The transcriptome analysis of the NAD-FOM1.2 interaction identified 2,461 and 821 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 24 hpi and at 48 hpi, respectively, while in susceptible combination CHT-FOM1.2, 882 and 2,237 DEGs were recovered at 24 hpi and at 48 hpi, respectively. The overall expression profile suggests a prompt activation of the defense responses in NAD due to its basal defense-related machinery that allows an early pathogen recognition. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed a total of 57 GO terms shared by both genotypes and consistent with response to fungal infection. GO classes named ""chitinase activity,"" ""cellulase activity,"" ""defense response, incompatible interaction,"" ""auxin polar transport"" emerged as major factors of resistance to FOM1.2. The data indicated that NAD reacts to FOM1.2 with a fine regulation of Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways, cell wall reorganization, and hormone crosstalk (jasmonate and ethylene, auxin and abscissic acid). Several unannotated transcripts were recovered providing a basis for a further exploration of the melon resistance genes. DEGs belonging to the FOM1.2 genome were also detected in planta as a resource for the identification of potential pathogenicity factors. This work provides a broader view of the dynamic changes of the melon transcriptome triggered by FOM1.2 and highlights that the resistance response of NAD is mainly signaled by jasmonic acid and ethylene pathways mediated by ABA and auxin. The role of candidate plant and fungal responsive genes involved in the resistance is discussed."
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 anorexia nervosa; body dissatisfaction; DSM-5; population study; protective association; religiosity; risk; religion and medicine; saints; women        	Since medieval times, an association between religiosity and anorexia nervosa has been suggested, but few systematic studies exist. This study examines in a nationwide setting whether personal or family religiosity is associated with lifetime anorexia nervosa among women in adolescence and early adulthood. Women (N = 2,825) from the 1975 to 1979 birth cohorts of Finnish twins were screened for lifetime DSM-5 anorexia nervosa (N = 92). Parental religiosity was assessed by self-report when the women were aged 16 years. The women self-reported their religiosity at ages 16 and 22 to 27 years. Parental religiosity did not increase the risk of lifetime anorexia nervosa, and neither did religiosity of the women themselves in adolescence. In early adulthood, a J-shaped curve was compatible with the data, indicating increased risk both at low and high levels of religiosity, but this result was statistically non-significant. Religiosity was weakly negatively correlated with body dissatisfaction. There was some suggestive evidence for socioregional variation in the association of religiosity with lifetime anorexia nervosa. In this first population study to directly address religiosity and anorexia nervosa, no evidence was found for a significant association of religiosity with anorexia nervosa either at the personal or family level. Some regional differences are possible. A modest protective association of religiosity with body dissatisfaction is also possible. Despite compelling case descriptions of holy anorexia, religiosity does not appear to be a central factor in the development of anorexia nervosa in Finland, a highly secularized Christian country.
2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Bipolar disorder; Borderline personality disorder; Digital health; Mood assessment; Mood monitoring; Patient reported outcome measures        	Background: Traditionally, assessment of psychiatric symptoms has been relying on their retrospective report to a trained interviewer. The emergence of smartphones facilitates passive sensor-based monitoring and active real-time monitoring through time-stamped prompts; however there are few validated self-report measures designed for this purpose. Methods: We introduce a novel, compact questionnaire, Mood Zoom (MZ), embedded in a customised smart-phone application. MZ asks participants to rate anxiety, elation, sadness, anger, irritability and energy on a 7-point Likert scale. For comparison, we used four standard clinical questionnaires administered to participants weekly to quantify mania (ASRM), depression (QIDS), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (EQ-5D). We monitored 48 Bipolar Disorder (BD), 31 Borderline Personality Disorders (BPD) and 51 Healthy control (HC) participants to study longitudinal (median +/- iqr: 313 +/- 194 days) variation and differences of mood traits by exploring the data using diverse time-series tools. Results: MZ correlated well (vertical bar R vertical bar>0. 5, p0. 3, p < 0.0001) differences in variability in all questionnaires for the three cohorts. Compared to HC, BD and BPD participants exhibit different trends and variability, and on average had higher self-reported scores in mania, depression, and anxiety, and lower quality of life. In particular, analysis of MZ variability can differentiate BD and BPD which was not hitherto possible using the weekly questionnaires. Limitations: All reported scores rely on self-assessment; there is a lack of ongoing clinical assessment by experts to validate the findings. Conclusions: MZ could be used for efficient, long-term, effective daily monitoring of mood instability in clinical psychiatric practice. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
5	26	98	Medical 	 HIV/AIDS  	 United States; HIV prevention; African American MSM; Ballroom house; Gay families; Social networks; Social support; Protective behaviors; Risk behaviors        	The endogenous social support systems of young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), like surrogate families and social networks, are considered crucial assets for HIV prevention in this population. Yet, the extent to which these social systems foster sexual health protections or risks remains unclear. We examine the networked patterns of membership in ballroom houses and independent gay families, both Black gay subcultures in the United States, and how these memberships are related to HIV protective and risk traits of members. Drawing from a population-based sample of 618 YBMSM living in Chicago between June 2013 and July 2014, we observe a suite of protective and risk traits and perform bivariate analyses to assess each of their associations with being a member of a house or family. We then present an analysis of the homophilous and heterophilous mixing on these traits that structures the patterns of house and family affiliations among members. The bivariate analyses show that members of the house and family communities were more likely than non-members to report protective traits like being aware of PrEP, having health coverage, having a primary care doctor, and discouraging sex drug use among peers. However, members were also more likely to engage in the use of sex drugs. With respect to how these traits inform specific house/family affiliations, results show that members who had a recent HIV test, who were PrEP aware, or who engaged in exchange sex were more likely to belong to the same house or family, while HIV positive individuals were less likely to cluster within houses or families. These findings provide insights regarding the strengths and vulnerabilities of the house and gay family communities that can inform more culturally specific interventions that build on the existing human and social capital in this milieu.

6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 elemental speciation; hyphenated instrumental techniques; organometallic compounds; alkylated metal(loid)s; metalloproteins; biomethylation        	The analytical methodology for speciation of metals and metalloids associated with alkyl groups and biomacromolecules is critically reviewed. Alkylated metals and metalloids are not only known to be produced by microbial methylation within most anaerobic compartments in the environment, but also in the course of enzymatic transformations during human metabolism. Because of the toxicological relevance of these compounds present in trace to ultratrace concentrations, firm species identification and exact quantification are essential. While many instrumental techniques coupling chromatography (GC, HPLC, CE, GE) with plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are available for quantification, methods used for structural identification often suffer from inadequate sensitivity (EI-MS, ESI-MS, MALDI-MS, FT-ICRMS). Other problems encountered are sample derivatisation artefacts, lack of suitable standards for quantification, lack of equilibrium between spikes and sample, and the integrity of metal-protein association during separation, in particular during SDS-PAGE. Selected application examples with respect to mercury and arsenic speciation will be discussed critically.
6	8	133	biochemistry 	 Southern blotting  	 T cell receptors; Gamma; Delta; Rearrangement; Channel catfish        	Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, T cell receptors (TCR) gamma and delta were identified by mining of expressed sequence tag databases, and full-length sequences were obtained by 5'-RACE and RT-PCR protocols. cDNAs for each of these TCR chains encode typical variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J), and constant (C) regions. Three TCR gamma V families, seven TCR gamma J sequences, and three TCR gamma C sequences were identified from sequencing of cDNA. Primer walking on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) confirmed that the TRG locus contained seven TRGJ segments and indicated that the locus consists of (V gamma 3-J gamma 6-C gamma 2)-(V gamma 1(n)-J gamma 7-C gamma 3)-(V gamma 2-J gamma 5-J gamma 4-J gamma 3-J gamma 2-J gamma 1-C gamma 1). In comparison for TCR delta, two V families, four TCR delta D sequences, one TCR delta J sequence, and one TCR delta C sequence were identified by cDNA sequencing. Importantly, the finding that some catfish TCR delta cDNAs contain TCR V alpha-D-J delta rearrangements and some TCR alpha cDNAs contain V delta-J alpha rearrangements strongly implies that the catfish TRA and TRD loci are linked. Finally, primer walking on BACs and Southern blotting suggest that catfish have four TRDD gene segments and a single TRDJ and TRDC gene. As in most vertebrates, all three reading frames of each of the catfish TRDD segments can be used in functional rearrangements, and more than one TRDD segment can be used in a single rearrangement. As expected, catfish TCR delta CDR3 regions are longer and more diverse than TCR gamma CDR3 regions, and as a group they utilize more nucleotide additions and contain more nucleotide deletions than catfish TCR gamma rearrangements.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 adipose tissue; oestrogen; stem cells; menopause; adipogenesis        	The goal of this study was to determine the effect of acute transdermal 17-oestradiol (E-2) on the adipogenic potential of subcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) in post-menopausal women. Post-menopausal women (n = 11; mean age 57 +/- 4.5 years) were treated for 2 weeks, in a randomized, cross-over design, with transdermal E-2 (0.15 mg) or placebo patches. Biopsies of abdominal (AB) and femoral (FEM) subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) were obtained after each treatment and mature adipocytes were analysed for cell size and ASC for their capacity for proliferation (growth rate), differentiation (triglyceride accumulation) and susceptibility to tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis. Gene expression of oestrogen receptors and (ESR1 and ESR2), perilipin 1 and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), was also assessed. In FEM SAT, but not AB SAT, 2 weeks of E-2 significantly (P = 0.03) increased ASC differentiation and whole SAT HSL mRNA expression (P = 0.03) compared to placebo. These changes were not associated with mRNA expression of oestrogen receptors and , but HSL expression was significantly increased in FEM SAT with transdermal E-2 treatment. Adipose-derived stem cells proliferation and apoptosis did not change in either SAT depot after E-2 compared with placebo. Short-term E-2 appeared to increase the adipogenic potential of FEM, but not AB, SAT in post-menopausal women with possible implications for metabolic disease. Future studies are needed to determine longer term impact of E-2 on regional SAT accumulation in the context of positive energy imbalance.

Three separate factors of religious fundamentalism were found through exploratory factor analysis of the Revised Religious Fundamentalism Scale, and these were named Righteous-Evil Worldview, True Religion, and Scriptural Literalism. Psychological well-being of individuals in court-mandated outpatient substance abuse treatment was found to be correlated with high levels of humor but not religious fundamentalism. Psychological well-being and humor were found to be related to satisfaction with services; no relationship was found between religious fundamentalism and satisfaction with services. One factor of religious fundamentalism, Scriptural Literalism, was found to be associated with high levels of depression and paranoia/hostility. Implications of these relationships for treatment and understanding of religious fundamentalism and psychological well-being are discussed.
1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 Free piston; Low temperature; Double acting Stirling engine; Electrical equivalent model; Optimization        	A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers.

6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Immunology; Issue 117; dog; NET; neutrophil extracellular trap; fluorescence; microplate assay; canine        	Neutrophil extracellular traps are networks of DNA, histones and neutrophil proteins released in response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. Although a component of the innate immune response, NETs are implicated in a range of disease processes including autoimmunity and thrombosis. This protocol describes a simple method for canine neutrophil isolation and quantification of NETs using a microplate fluorescence assay. Blood is collected using conventional venipuncture techniques. Neutrophils are isolated using dextran sedimentation and a density gradient using conditions optimized for dog blood. After allowing time for attachment to the wells of a 96 well plate, neutrophils are treated with NET-inducing agonists such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or platelet activating factor. DNA release is measured by the fluorescence of a cell-impermeable nucleic acid dye. This assay is a simple, inexpensive method for quantifying NET release, but NET formation rather than other causes of cell death must be confirmed with alternative methods.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Small RNA; Degradation; Purification; Gel elution        	Purification of RNA fragments from a complex mixture is a very common technique, and requires consideration of the time, cost, purity and yield of the purified RNA fragments. This study describes the fastest method of purifying small RNA with the lowest cost possible, without compromizing the yield and purity. The technique describes the purification of small RNA from polyacrylamide gel, resulting in a good yield of small RNA with minimum experimental steps in avoiding degradation of the RNA, obviating the use of ethidium bromide and phenol-chloroform extraction, as well as siliconized glass wools to remove the polyacrylamide gel particles. The purified small RNA is suitable for a wide variety of applications such as ligation, end labelling with radio isotope, RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase-PCR), Northern blotting, experimental RNomics study and also Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX).
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 Gender Differences; Fibrosis; Risk Factor Analysis.        	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sex and sex hormones can affect responses of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to metabolic stress and development of hepatocyte injury and inflammation. METHODS: We collected data from 3 large U.S. studies of patients with NAFLD (between October 2004 and June 2013) to assess the association between histologic severity and sex, menopause status, synthetic hormone use, and menstrual abnormalities in 1112 patients with a histologic diagnosis of NAFLD. We performed logistic or ordinal logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates relevant to an increase of hepatic metabolic stress. RESULTS: Premenopausal women were at an increased risk of lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and Mallory-Denk bodies than men and also at an increased risk of lobular inflammation and Mallory-Denk bodies than postmenopausal women (P < .01). Use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of lobular inflammation and Mallory-Denk bodies in premenopausal women, whereas hormone replacement therapy was associated with an increased risk of lobular inflammation in postmenopausal women (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Being a premenopausal woman or a female user of synthetic hormones is associated with increased histologic severity of hepatocyte injury and inflammation among patients with NAFLD at given levels of hepatic metabolic stress.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 Subclinical hypothyroidism; Lipid metabolism; Cardiovascular disease; Cardiovascular risk        	Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum thyrotropin in presence of normal free thyroid hormones. Lipid metabolism is influenced by thyroid hormone and many reports showed that lipids status worsen alongwith TSH level. Subclinical hypothyroidismhas been also linked to other cardiovascular risk factors such as alteration in blood pressure and increased atherosclerosis. Further evidences suggested that mild dysfunction of thyroid gland is associated withmetabolic syndrome and heart failure. Thyrotropin level seems the best predictor of cardiovascular disease, in particular when its levels are above 10 mU/L. However, despite these observations, there is no clear evidence that levothyroxine therapy in subjects with milder form of subclinical hypothyroidism could improve lipid status and the other cardiovascular risk factors. In this review, we address the effect of thyroid hormone and cardiovascular risk, with a focus on lipid metabolism. (C) 2016 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B. V.

The texture withcrystallographic direction preferentially oriented perpendicular to foil surface has been observed. The Sigma 3, Sigma 9 and Sigma 33 grain boundaries (GBs) were more frequent in experimental dataset than in simulated random one. The {111} GB planes are the most frequently observed. Similar enrichment in {111} planes was obtained for simulated set of GBs if texture of the foil and GB planes orientation is taken into account. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
1	13	30	ECE 	 State space representation  	 Microgrid; state-space model; small-signal stability; sensitivity analysis; induction motor        	Microgrid concept provides an appropriate context for installing distributed generation resources and providing reliability and power quality for sensitive loads. Most of the literature have analyzed the effects of different power control strategies of inverter-based distributed energy resources on the stability of microgrids and only a few of them have addressed various load models in their formulation and analysis. This paper proposes a well-structured formulation for state-space representation of comprehensive static and dynamic load models in an islanded microgrids environment. Impact of considering induction motor models on root loci of eigenvalues is analyzed and sensitivity calculation is performed to account for the effect of different load model parameters on system oscillatory modes.
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 Spiropyran; Merocyanine; Polythiourathene; Shape memory polymer        	We demonstrate the fabrication and response of a smart material combined with spiropyran molecules. Spiropyrans belong to a class of compound that constitute molecular switch. They change color in response to different stimuli such as heat, UV light or mechanical stress. These molecules have been incorporated in polythiourethane (PTU) which is a shape memory polymer. The observations revealed that the molecular switches do not alter the physical properties of the PTU in general; however, both, the spiropyran molecules and smart polymer show changes individually when exposed to heat. The microscopic mechanisms of switching process in response to external stimuli have been discussed in detail.
0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 Magnetism; Brillouin function; Inverse of Brillouin function; Modelling        	"Purpose - The mathematical complexity of the B-J (x) Brillouin function makes it unsuitable for most calculations and its application difficult for computer programming in magnetism. Here, its approximation with the tanh function is proposed to ease the mathematical operations for most cases. The approximation works with good accuracy, acceptable in practical calculations. This approximation has already formed the foundation of the ""hyperbolic model"" in magnetism for the study of hysteretic phenomena. The reversal of the Brillouin function is an important but difficult mathematical problem for practical purposes. Here, a proposal has been put forward for an easy approximation using an analytical expression. This provides a good workable solution for the BJ (x)- 1 function dependent on J, the angular momentum quantum number of the material used. The proposed approximation is applicable within the working range of practical applications. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The multi-variant Brillouin function is closely approximated by the tanh function to ease calculations. Its mathematically unsolved reversed function is approximated by a simple analytical expression with a good working accuracy. Findings - The Brillouin function and its reversal can be approximated for practical users mostly for professionals working in Magnetism. Research limitations/implications - Most if not all practical problems in Magnetism can be solved within the limitations of the two approximations. Practical implications - Both proposed functions can ease the mathematical problems faced by researchers and other users in Magnetism. Social implications - Ease the frustration of most users working in the field of Magnetism. Originality/value - The application of the tanh function for replacing the Brillouin function led to the creation of the hyperbolic model of hysteresis. To the author's knowledge, the reverse function was mathematically only solved in 2015 with a vastly complicated mathematics, and is hardly suitable for practical calculations in Magnetism. The proposed simple expression can be very useful for theorists and experimental scientists."
5	21	93	Medical 	 Headache  	 Episodic migraine; Functional connectivity; Magnetic resonance imaging; Periaqueductal gray; Resting-state functional MRI        	Background: The periaqueductal gray (PAG) dysfunction was recognized in migraine, and the altered dysfunction of PAG subregions were not totally detected up to now. The aim of this study is to investigate the altered functional connectivity of PAG subregions in EM patients. Methods: The brain structural images and resting state functional MR imaging (rs-fMRI) data were obtained from 18 normal controls (NC) and 18 EM patients on 3.0 T MR system. Seven subregions of PAG were classified as bilateral ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), lateral PAG (lPAG), dorsolateral PAG (dlPAG) and dorsomedial PAG (dmPAG). The functional connectivity maps of each PAG subregion were calculated, and Two sample t-test was applied with age and sex as covariables. Results: Bilateral vlPAG and left dlPAG presented decreased functional connectivity, and the other subregions (bilateral lPAGs, right dlPAG and dmPAG) showed no significant altered functional connectivity in EM compared with NC. The brain regions with decreased functional connectivity mainly located in bilateral prefrontal cortex(PFC), middle temporal gyrus, primary motor area (PMA) and supplementary motor area (SMA) and right ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) in EM patients in this study. Disease duration was positively related to the functional connectivity of bilateral vlPAG on the bilateral thalamus and putamen, left pallidum and right medial orbitofrontal gyrus in EM patients. Conclusion: The present study suggested that the dysfunction of bilateral vlPAG and left dlPAG presented in EM, and functional evaluation of PAG subregions may be help for the diagnosis and understanding of EM pathogenesis.

5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 Platinum(II) complexes; Demethylcantharidate; N-monoalkyl-1R   2R-diaminocyclohexane; Cytotoxicity; Apoptosis       	Nine platinum(II) complexes with N-monoalkyl 1R, 2R-DACH derivatives as carrier ligands and demethyl-cantharidate as a leaving group were synthesized and spectrally characterized. All the complexes showed considerable cytotoxicity against tested human cancer cell lines: A549, HCT116 HepG-2 and MCF7 cell lines. Especially, complex 2 exhibited potent cytotoxicity against A549 (1.01 mu M) and HCT116 (0.83 mu M) cell lines, and showed no cross-resistance to cisplatin against SGC7901/CDDP cell line (RF = 1.44). In addition, the typical compounds were further studied by flow cytometric analysis and western blot method. The results indicated that they induced apoptosis by a mitochondrial-dependent pathway, which were similar to cisplatin. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; CD-RISC; resilience; predictive validity; United States Air Force        	Results are presented for the largest study (N = 53,692) ever conducted on the 25-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), a popular measure of resilience. We examined the internal consistency of the CD-RISC items and associated mean resilience levels within a sample of enlisted basic trainees in the United States Air Force. In addition, the predictive validity of the CD-RISC Total Score was examined for real-life military outcomes, including attrition from service and mental health diagnosis. The CD-RISC items demonstrated strong internal consistency. Item-level examinations of scores revealed that most trainees reported relatively high resilience. Results indicated that resilience measured at the beginning of military service is a significant predictor of (a) attrition from service and (b) obtaining a mental health diagnosis within 6 months of entry. Implications and future directions are discussed.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Parenting practices; Child routines; Self-regulation; Externalizing behaviors; Preschool        	Background Studies clearly indicate that parenting practices relate to child externalizing behaviors, although the mechanisms underlying this relation are less well understood. There has been limited evaluation of child routines and self-regulation in relation to these variables, and no known studies have evaluated all of these variables simultaneously. Objective This study examined child routines and self-regulation as serial mediators of the relations between positive and negative parenting practices (separately) and child externalizing problems among preschool children. Methods Participants included 146 maternal caregivers of preschool children who completed measures of their parenting practices and of their child's daily routines, self-regulation, and externalizing behaviors. Results Results demonstrated that both child routines and self-regulation are significant mechanisms through which negative and positive parenting practices relate to externalizing problems in preschoolers, although the temporal sequencing was only upheld with respect to negative parenting. Our findings offer preliminary evidence that child routines may play a critical role in self-regulation development among preschool children, which, in turn, is inversely associated with externalizing behaviors. Conclusion Although further study is needed, these findings suggest that child routines and self-regulation development may be key components to incorporate clinically and evaluate empirically among intervention programs designed to prevent early development of behavior problems in preschool children.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Biofuel mix; Bioethanol; Spark-ignited (Otto-cycle) internal; combustion engine; Operative engine performances; Environmental engine performances        	Bioethanol-gasoline blends represent for Otto-cycle engines a consolidated alternative in the attempts to reduce GHG emissions and to limit the use of fossil fuels. However, the use of alternative fuels can strongly influence the performance of engines. The purpose of this study is to analyse the output and the pollutant emissions of a four-stroke SI engine fuelled with 0%, 50% and 80% bioethanol-gasoline blends. Tests were performed on a 3-kW engine used in broad applications. No specific modifications were applied to the carburetion system in order to evaluate its fuel flexibility capabilities. The tests evidenced that the mixture tends to get lean with alcoholic fuels; the brake specific fuel consumption increased due to the lower LHV of bioethanol, while the highest brake thermal efficiency was obtained with E50. Minor torque and power reductions were recorded with the ethanol blends. The concentration of UHC decreased with E50 and E80 while NOx emissions reduced because of the lower combustion temperature due to the bioethanol cooling effect and the leaner mixture. In contrast, the concentration of CO increased because a poor homogenization of the charge and a lower combustion temperature had facilitated the formation of partial oxidation products.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 branched-chain amino acids; C. glutamicum; L-isoleucine; NADPH; pentose phosphate pathway        	Three genes, gnd, pgl, and fbp, relevant to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were overexpressed in Corynebacterium glutamicum IWJ001, leading to increase of L-isoleucine production. The transcriptional levels of gnd, pgl, and fbp significantly increased in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl. Compared with the control strain IWJ001/pDXW-8, intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratios in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd and IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp cells grown for 36 H increased threefold and fourfold, respectively, indicating that overexpression of gnd and fbp redirected the carbon flux to PPP. Intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) ratio in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grown for 36 H was similar to IWJ001/pDXW-8, suggesting that the NADPH produced by PPP could be quickly consumed for L-isoleucine production. 10.9 and 28.96 g/L of L-isoleucine was produced in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl in shake flask cultivation and fed-batch fermentation, respectively. In addition, IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl grew fast, its dry cell weight reached 49 g/L after 48 H, whereas the start strain IWJ001/pDXW-8 reached only 40 g/L. After 96 H fermentation, L-isoleucine yield on glucose in IWJ001/pDXW-8-gnd-fbp-pgl reached 0.138 g/g. The results demonstrate that carbon flux redirection to PPP is an efficient approach to enhance L-isoleucine production in C. glutamicum.

Using new high quality positron emission particle tracking data, the volume and time averaged kinematic distributions of the granular (glass beads) and slurry (silica sand and water) mixture are computed. Incorporating these measured ingredients into the model then reveals that turbulence is not described by the usual effective viscosity, but nonetheless is negligible such that the new Inertial Cell Equation is first order in spatial derivatives.

2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 hospice care; palliative care; quality improvement; quality measures; quality team        	Now more than ever, it is essential for hospice and palliative care nurse leaders to be front and center in the quality improvement (QI) arena. Because nurses are integral to the delivery of hospice and palliative care, they are pivotal in efforts to improve quality. This article sought to provide an in-depth understanding of the leadership role that nurses can play in QI activities from project inception and team formation, to the planning stage. The analysis revealed that hospice and palliative care nurses have a leadership role at the onset of the QI project that includes active team membership as a QI team leader, team member, and/or champion. Nurses also have a leadership role in formulating the project aims and choosing the appropriate project model within their organizations. Finally, hospice and palliative care nurses use their planning skills to develop QI project measures, data collection plan, data analysis plan, and communication/implementation/evaluation plan. The QI project provides opportunities for hospice and palliative care nurse leaders to use their clinical, technical, and administrative knowledge to improve the care of patients and families at the end of life.
5	27	99	Medical 	 Hypothyroidism  	 thyroid disorder; electrolyte imbalance; myxedema; sodium disturbances        	Background: Hypothyroidism is referred to be a rare but possible cause of hyponatremia. However, there is only poor evidence supporting this association. Since hyponatremia and hypothyroidism are both common conditions themselves, co-occurrence does not have to be causal. Methods: To address a potential relationship, a retrospective analysis of data from the Division of Endocrinology of the Medical University of Vienna from April 2004 to February 2016 was performed. A total of 8053 hypothyroid patients (48 +/- 18 years of age; 71% female) with thyrotropin >4.0 mu IU/mL and available blood tests for free thyroxine and sodium (Na+) within maximal +/- seven days were included and screened for hyponatremia. Patients' records were searched for concomitant disease and medication when Na+ concentration was <135 mmol/L. Results: Hyponatremia was present in 448/8053 (5.56%) patients. Analysis of medical history revealed potential alternative causes of hyponatremia in 442/448 (98.88%) patients (i.e., side effects of medication, concomitant underlying disease, or other endocrine disorders). This distribution did not differ between patients suffering from clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism. No case of clinically relevant hyponatremia (Na+ < 130 mmol/L), present in 111/448 (24.78%) patients could be attributed only to hypothyroidism. There was a very weak but statistically significant trend toward a positive association between thyroid function and serum Na+ levels (Na+/thyrotropin: R = 0.022, p = 0.046; Na+/free thyroxine: R=-0.047, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that hypothyroid patients with moderate to severe hyponatremia often have other potential explanations for their low serum Na+ concentrations in routine care.
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 Geosynthetics; Grid-anchor; Interfaces; Laboratory tests; Direct shear test        	In recent years, the study of the shear strength of soil with geosynthetics has caught the attention of scholars. In this study, by changing the traditional geogrid structure and adding polymeric anchors to the reinforcement grid, naming it Grid-Anchor (G-A), it is sought to experimentally analyze the performance of this new system by increasing the Coefficient of Interaction Ratio in Direct Shear (CIRDS). To achieve this, 16 large-scale direct shear tests were conducted on a typical geogrid and G-A system. The results of this showed that CIRDS is, on average, 1.45 times greater. In other words, the interaction between soil and the reinforcement in G-A system increases by almost 50% compared to that of typical geogrid regarding direct shear mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 Patient reported outcome measures; questionnaires; ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease; clinical trials        	Patient reported outcome measures [PROMs] are standardized, validated questionnaires intended for completion by patients in order to measure their perceptions of their own health condition or its treatment without interpretation of the patient's response by a clinician or anyone else. Mayo Clinic Score [MCS] or Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI], most frequently used as end points in conventional clinical trials, are composite instruments that are not fully objective nor capture the impact of disease from the patient's perspective. They are difficult to apply to routine clinical practice because they are complex and time consuming. The European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration are re-evaluating composite indices in clinical trials and product development guidelines. The ultimate goal is to support labelling claims to improve safety and effectiveness of medical products through PROMs allied to an objective measure of inflammation, as happens informally in clinical practice. PROMs, developed and validated according to rigorous criteria, are set to become a co-primary end point for clinical trials of therapy, together with objective measure[s] of inflammation. This will affect future trials' design and their results. To find a place in routine care, PROMs should be easy to use, acceptable to patients and healthcare teams, and able to demonstrate added value to normal practice, supporting decision-making at the level of individual patients. Ideally, the same PROMs should be used in clinical trials and practice, to avoid the current disconnect when interpreting the results of clinical trials and translating them into routine clinical practice.
0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 transcriptomics; gene expression; skin; sebaceous gland; apocrine gland; sweat gland; psoriasis        	Numerous studies have explored the altered transcriptional landscape associated with skin diseases to understand the nature of these disorders. However, data interpretation represents a significant challenge due to a lack of good maker sets for many of the specialized cell types that make up this tissue, whose composition may fundamentally alter during disease. Here we have sought to derive expression signatures that define the various cell types and structures that make up human skin, and demonstrate how they can be used to aid the interpretation of transcriptomic data derived from this organ. Two large normal skin transcriptomic datasets were identified, one RNA-seq (n = 578), the other microarray (n = 165), quality controlled and subjected separately to network-based analyses to identify clusters of robustly co-expressed genes. The biological significance of these clusters was then assigned using a combination of bioinformatics analyses, literature, and expert review. After cross comparison between analyses, 20 gene signatures were defined. These included expression signatures for hair follicles, glands (sebaceous, sweat, apocrine), keratinocytes, melanocytes, endothelia, muscle, adipocytes, immune cells, and a number of pathway systems. Collectively, we have named this resource SkinSig. SkinSig was then used in the analysis of transcriptomic datasets for 18 skin conditions, providing in-context interpretation of these data. For instance, conventional analysis has shown there to be a decrease in keratinization and fatty metabolism with age; we more accurately define these changes to be due to loss of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. SkinSig also highlighted the over-/under-representation of various cell types in skin diseases, reflecting an influx in immune cells in inflammatory disorders and a relative reduction in other cell types. Overall, our analyses demonstrate the value of this new resource in defining the functional profile of skin cell types and appendages, and in improving the interpretation of disease data.

5	29	101	Medical 	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome  	 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT); Abdominal pain; Abdominal discomfort; Global improvement; Stool consistency; Irritable bowel syndrome severity index        	"Background: Previous studies have indicated that ramosetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist, achieves global improvement in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in male patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). However, in addition to global assessment it was deemed important to assess ""clinically meaningful improvements, focusing on the patient's chief complaint and the severity of major IBS symptoms"". We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase IV pilot study to explore and examine efficacy variables that allow such evaluation of ramosetron in male patients with IBS-D. Methods: We performed a prospective study of 115 male outpatients with IBS-D (according to the Rome III criteria), from June 2009 to December 2009 at 25 centers in Japan. After a one-week baseline period, subjects received either 5 mu g of ramosetron (n = 47) or placebo (n = 51) once daily for 12 weeks. To evaluate ""clinically meaningful improvements focusing on the severity of major IBS symptoms,"" the Japanese version of the IBS severity index (IBSSI-J) was used. Results: Change in IBSSI-J overall score from baseline was -133.5 +/- 110.72 in the ramosetron 5 mu g group and -108.2 +/- 94.44 in the placebo group (P = 0.228) at the last evaluation point. Differences in responder rates for at least a 50% reduction from baseline in IBSSI-J between the ramosetron 5 mu g group and the placebo group were over 10%, except Month 1. The monthly responder rate for global assessment of relief of overall IBS symptoms in the ramosetron 5 mu g group showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo at the second month (44.4% vs 18.4%, P = 0.012). The proportion of patients who had a = 50% reduction in IBSSI-J overall score was 24/37 (64.9%) in the responder group on global assessment and 18/54 (33.3%) in the non-responder group at Week 12. Conclusions: Further examination will be needed before IBSSI-J can be used in clinical trials of agents for IBS-D. However, this study revealed that response on global assessment was correlated with improvement in the IBSSI-J, suggesting that global assessment reflects improvement"

The term MPN is mostly used for classical BCR-ABL-negative (myeloproliferative disorder) (ET, PV, PMF). These are clonal diseases resulting from the transformation of an hematopoietic stem cell and leading to an abnormal production of myeloid cells. The genetic defects responsible for the myeloproliferative abnormalities are called ""driver"" mutations and all result in deregulation of the cytokine receptor / JAK2 / STAT axis. Among them, JAK2, the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) mutations are found in around 90% of the cases. These driver MPN mutations can be associated with other driver mutations also found in other hematological malignancies, especially in PMFs. These are chronic diseases with major risks being thrombosis, hemorrhage and cytopenias for PMF and the long-term progression to myelofibrosis and the transformation to leukemia. Most recent therapeutic have focused on targeting the JAK2 signaling pathway directly by inhibitors of JAK2 or indirectly.

2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Social movements; social networks; content analysis; connective action; user behavior; Gezi Park        	As social movements relying on the weak ties found in social networks have spread around the world, researchers have taken several approaches to understanding how networks function in such instances as the Arab Spring. While social scientists have primarily relied on survey or content analysis methodology, network scientists have used social network analysis. This research combines content analysis with the automated techniques of network analysis to determine the roles played by those using Twitter to communicate during the Turkish Gezi Park uprising. Based on a network analysis of nearly 2.4 million tweets and a content analysis of a subset of 5126 of those tweets, we found that information sharing was by far the most common use of the tweets and retweets, while tweets that indicated leadership of the movement constituted a small percentage of the overall number of tweets. Using automated techniques, we experimented with coded variables from content analysis to compute the most discriminative tokens and to predict values for each variable using only textual information. We achieved 0.61 precision on identifying types of shared information. Our results on detecting the position of user in the protest and purpose of the tweets achieved 0.42 and 0.33 precision, respectively, illustrating the necessity of user cooperation and the shortcomings of automated techniques. Based on annotated values of user tweets, we computed similarities between users considering their information production and consumption. User similarities are used to compute clusters of individuals with similar behaviors, and we interpreted average activities for those groups.
5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 cancer stem cells; cellular markers; self-renewal; side population; sphere; tumorigenicity        	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) as a small subset of neoplastic cells are able to produce a tumor (tumorigenesis), maintain the population of tumorigenic cells (self-renewal), and generate the heterogeneous cells constructing the entire tumor (pluripotency). The research on stationary and circulating CSCs due to resistance to conventional therapies and inability in complete eradication of cancer is critical for developing novel therapeutic strategies for a more effective reduction in the risk of tumor metastasis and cancer recurrence. This review compiles information about different methods of detection and dissociation, side population, cellular markers, and establishment culture of CSCs, as well as characteristics of CSCs such as tumorigenicity, and signaling pathways associated with self-renewal and the capability of the same histological tumor regeneration in various cancers.
3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 density functional theory; isocyanate; isothiocyanate; oligomerization; polymerization        	Coupling between iso(thio) cyanates and amines, alcohols, and thiols to yield (thio) urea/urethane in the gas phase is important for the vacuum deposition processes of functional organic thin films such as molecular layer deposition or chemical vapor deposition. In this study, the kinetics and thermodynamics of 12 reactions between bifunctional reactants containing -NCO/-NCS and -NH2/-OH/-SH moieties were calculated using double-hybrid density functional theory to find systematic structure-reactivity relationships. The activation energy for the proton-transfer step was correlated with the basicity of the nucleophile/Bronsted acid reactants, while the exothermicity of the coupling reaction depends on whether the other functionality is -NCO or -NCS. Analysis of the transition states revealed that the location of the transition state is affected by the basicity of the reactants. Vibrational and electronic spectra of the product were obtained to help future experimental investigations.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 cuttings; genotype improvement; in vitro; plant growth regulators (PGRs); seed; vegetative propagation        	Eucalyptus spp. and hybrids remain among the mostly widely-planted species in the world, owed principally to its diverse genome, its site-adaptability, and relatively fast growth rates. Numerous pure species, and yet more hybrid clones have been globally deployed in plantations, as industry seeks to meet growing demands for wood and their products. As a result, various propagation approaches have been explored, from seeds to vegetative propagation by cuttings and trough in vitro method, with a view to remaining cost-effective, yet efficient, and sustainable. Vegetative propagation of eucalypts is preferred, as it conserves valuable germplasm and offers predictability in commercial foplantations. The range of eucalypt species and hybrids in commercial use, however, has resulted in an array of propagation protocols, as researchers seek to optimise growth conditions to enhance the quality and yields of rooted cuttings and in vitro propagules. The exogenous supply of plant growth regulators (PGRs) is central to the objectives of these protocols. The present review traces recent developments in Eucalyptus propagation, and presents a selection of published protocols for a variety of species, explants and PGR supply. With advancements in plant physiology, molecular biology and biochemistry, a clearer picture of the vegetative physiological growth requirements steadily develops, leading researchers to more accurately manipulate and improve Eucalyptus propagation. Furthermore, the recent completion of the E. grandis genome sequence will drive advancements in eucalypt genomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. Collectively, these developments will present future opportunities to accurately decipher, augment and significantly enhance sustainable growth, yields, valuable traits and germplasm conservation of the eucalypts.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 chitin synthase; Fusarium graminearum; RNAi; Triticum aestivum        	Fusarium head blight (FHB) and Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) of wheat, caused by Fusarium pathogens, are devastating diseases worldwide. We report the expression of RNA interference (RNAi) sequences derived from an essential Fusarium graminearum (Fg) virulence gene, chitin synthase (Chs) 3b, as a method to enhance resistance of wheat plants to fungal pathogens. Deletion of Chs3b was lethal to Fg; disruption of the other Chs gene family members generated knockout mutants with diverse impacts on Fg. Comparative expression analyses revealed that among the Chs gene family members, Chs3b had the highest expression levels during Fg colonization of wheat. Three hairpin RNAi constructs corresponding to the different regions of Chs3b were found to silence Chs3b in transgenic Fg strains. Co-expression of these three RNAi constructs in two independent elite wheat cultivar transgenic lines conferred high levels of stable, consistent resistance (combined type I and II resistance) to both FHB and FSB throughout the T-3 to T-5 generations. Confocal microscopy revealed profoundly restricted mycelia in Fg-infected transgenic wheat plants. Presence of the three specific short interfering RNAs in transgenic wheat plants was confirmed by Northern blotting, and these RNAs efficiently down-regulated Chs3b in the colonizing Fusarium pathogens on wheat seedlings and spikes. Our results demonstrate that host-induced gene silencing of an essential fungal chitin synthase gene is an effective strategy for enhancing resistance in crop plants under field test conditions.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Zeotropic mixtures; Dual-loop organic Rankine cycle (DORC); Waste heat recovery; Thermodynamic analysis; Economic performance        	Siloxanes are usually used in the high temperature organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for engine waste heat recovery, but their flammability limits the practical application. Besides, blending siloxanes with retardants often brings a great temperature glide, causing the large condensation heat and the reduction in net output power. In view of this, the zeotropic mixtures based on siloxanes used in a dual-loop organic Rankine cycle (DORC) system are proposed in this paper. Three kinds of binary zeotropic mixtures consisting of R123 and various siloxanes (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane 'D4', octamethyltrisiloxane 'MDM', decamethyltetrasiloxane 'MD2M'), represented by D4/R123, MDM/R123 and MD2M/R123, are selected as the working fluid of the high temperature (HT) cycle. Meanwhile, R123 is always used in the low temperature (LT) cycle. The net output power and utilization of heat source are considered as the evaluation indexes to select the optimal mixture ratios for further analysis. Based on the thermodynamic and economic model, net output power, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, exergy destruction and electricity production cost (EPC) of the DORC system using the selected mixtures have been investigated under different operating parameters. According to the results, the DORC based on D4/12123 (0.3/0.7) shows the best thermodynamic performance with the largest net power of 21.66 kW and the highest thermal efficiency of 22.84%. It also has the largest exergy efficiency of 48.6% and the smallest total exergy destruction of 19.64 kW. The DORC using MD2M/R123 (0.35/0.65) represents the most economic system with the smallest EPC of 0.603 $/kW h. Besides, the irreversibility in the internal heat exchanger, turbine and evaporator of HT cycle contributes most to the total exergy destruction which can serve as the parameter to be optimized in the further study.

2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 face perception; social cognition; person perception; impression formation        	"First impressions of social traits, such as trustworthiness or dominance, are reliably perceived in faces, and despite their questionable validity they can have considerable real-world consequences. We sought to uncover the information driving such judgments, using an attribute-based approach. Attributes (physical facial features) were objectively measured from feature positions and colors in a database of highly variable ""ambient"" face photographs, and then used as input for a neural network to model factor dimensions (approachability, youthful-attractiveness, and dominance) thought to underlie social attributions. A linear model based on this approach was able to account for 58% of the variance in raters' impressions of previously unseen faces, and factor-attribute correlations could be used to rank attributes by their importance to each factor. Reversing this process, neural networks were then used to predict facial attributes and corresponding image properties from specific combinations of factor scores. In this way, the factors driving social trait impressions could be visualized as a series of computer-generated cartoon face-like images, depicting how attributes change along each dimension. This study shows that despite enormous variation in ambient images of faces, a substantial proportion of the variance in first impressions can be accounted for through linear changes in objectively defined features."

Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are a possible obstacle to using porcine organs in addition to the immunological barriers. Three main types of PERVs (A, B and C) have been previously investigated in diverse pig breeds. To examine the copy numbers of PERVs and their genomic locations in the Korean native pig genome, we screened a BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) library with PERV-specific protease primers for initial recognition of PERV-positive clones and three sets of envelope-specific primers for the identification of PERV types. A total of 45 PERV-positive clones, nine PERV-A and 36 PERV-B, have been identified from the library screening and the BAC contigs were constructed using the primers designed from BAC end sequences (BESs). These primers were also used for SCH (Somatic Cell Hybrid) and RH (Radiation Hybrid) mapping of the PERV-positive clones. The results indicate that 45 PERV-positive BAC clones belong to nine contigs and a singleton. SCH and IMpRH (INRA-Minnesota Porcine Radiation Hybrid) mapping results indicated that there are at least eight separate PERV genomic locations, consisting of three PERV-A and five PERV-B. One contig could not be mapped, and two contigs are closely located on SSC7. Southern blotting indicates there may be up to 15 additional sites. Further investigation of these clones will contribute to a general strategy to generate PERV-free lines of pigs suitable for xenotransplantation.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 Retinoic acid receptor; Retinoic acid receptor; All trans retinoic acid; Endometrial cancer        	Objective Several studies have reported that retinoic acid (RA) might be used to treat malignancies. The effects of RA are mediated by the RA receptor (RAR), and RAR/RAR especially acts as a tumor suppressor. However, little is known about its role in human endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods In this study, we examined the effects of all-trans RA (ATRA) on progression of human endometrial cancer cell line, RL95-2 and Hec1A. We then examined the expression of RAR and RAR in 50 endometrial cancer tissues by using immunohistochemistry. Results We found inhibitory effects of ATRA on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration in RL95-2 cells, but not in Hec1A cells. RAR or RAR knockdown individually could not cancel out the inhibition of cell proliferation by ATRA in RL95-2 cells, but simultaneous knockdown of RAR and RAR could block its effect on proliferation. RAR and RAR knockdown dose dependently reduced the inhibition of migration by ATRA, but the effect was more pronounced with RAR knockdown than with RAR knockdown. We confirmed that RAR gene was directly regulated by ATRA in microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RAR agonist (BMS453) significantly suppressed proliferation of RL95-2 cells. In immunohistochemical analysis, RAR expression was positively correlated with tumor grade, and RAR showed the opposite tendency in endometrial cancer. Conclusions Retinoic acid might have multiple antitumor effects, and RAR may be a potent therapeutic target in RA treatment for endometrial cancers.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 channel flow; energy equation; mechanical energy loss; resistance        	The mechanical energy loss and the wall resistance are very important in practical engineering. These problems are investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation in this paper. The results are as follows. (1) A new mechanical energy equation for the total flow is obtained, and a general formula for the calculation of the mechanical energy loss is proposed. (2) The general relationship between the wall resistance and the mechanical energy loss for the steady channel flow is obtained, the simplified form of which for the steady uniform channel flow is in consistent with the formula used in Hydraulics deduced by pi theorem and dimensional analysis. (3) The steady channel flow over a backward facing step with a small expansion ratio is numerically simulated, and the mechanical energy loss, the wall resistance as well as the relationship between the wall resistance and the mechanical energy loss are calculated and analyzed.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Water pollution; GWR; OLS; Multicollinearity; Wen-Rui Tang River        	As an important regulator of pollutants in overland flow and interflow, land use has become an essential research component for determining the relationships between surface water quality and pollution sources. This study investigated the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models to identify the impact of land use and population density on surface water quality in the Wen-Rui Tang River watershed of eastern China. A manual variable excluding-selecting method was explored to resolve multicollinearity issues. Standard regression coefficient analysis coupled with cluster analysis was introduced to determine which variable had the greatest influence on water quality. Results showed that: (1) Impact of land use on water quality varied with spatial and seasonal scales. Both positive and negative effects for certain land-use indicators were found in different subcatchments. (2) Urban land was the dominant factor influencing N, P and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in highly urbanized regions, but the relationship was weak as the pollutants were mainly from point sources. Agricultural land was the primary factor influencing N and P in suburban and rural areas; the relationship was strong as the pollutants were mainly from agricultural surface runoff. Subcatchments located in suburban areas were identified with urban land as the primary influencing factor during the wet season while agricultural land was identified as a more prevalent influencing factor during the dry season. (3) Adjusted R-2 values in OLS models using the manual variable excluding-selecting method averaged 14.3% higher than using stepwise multiple linear regressions. However, the corresponding GWR models had adjusted R-2 similar to 59.2% higher than the optimal OLS models, confirming that GWR models demonstrated better prediction accuracy. Based on our findings, water resource protection policies should consider site-specific land-use conditions within each watershed to optimize mitigation strategies for contrasting land-use characteristics and seasonal variations.

4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 Suspension bridges; Frictional resistance; Analytical model; Model test; Coefficient of friction        	For multispan suspension bridges, frictional resistance between the main cables and the saddles is essential for counterpoising unbalanced cable tension between different spans. The use of friction plates in saddles is one of the most common methods for increasing frictional resistance, and the corresponding evaluation method is vital for the design of suspension bridges. In this study, an analytical model for the calculation of frictional resistance between cables and saddles is presented. Large-scale model tests were performed to simulate the realistic friction conditions of a typical multispan suspension bridge in China, namely the Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge, to validate the model. The main components of frictional resistance were analyzed, and the effects of vertical friction plates in enhancing frictional resistance were investigated by model tests and theoretical analyses. The results indicate that the presented analytical model provides an effective and feasible tool for evaluating the total frictional resistance and the contribution of friction plates in practice. The main components of total frictional resistance, including the frictions at the base and side contact interfaces between the cable and the saddle trough, are quantified, proving the former to be dominant. The parameter analyses reveal that the frictional resistance can be increased by 57% by incorporating six vertical friction plates for the actual saddle.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 Natural circulation; Internal heat generation; Stability analysis; Thermal-hydraulics; Object-oriented modelling; RELAP5        	This paper deals with the influence of the piping material thermal and geometrical properties on the dynamic stability of single-phase natural circulation loops. To this purpose, a semi-analytical approach is developed by adopting the tools provided by the linear analysis. By considering a generic natural circulation loop configuration with a localized heat flux and a homogenously distributed Internal Heat Generation (IHG), the governing equations (mass, momentum and energy balance) are linearized around a steady-state solution of the system and treated by means of the Fourier transform to obtain dimensionless stability maps. Moreover, in order to verify the linear analysis methodology, a numerical strategy is adopted to solve the nonlinear governing equations and to investigate the natural circulation dynamics in the time domain. In principle, both the developed approaches can be applied to any natural circulation loop configuration. In the present work, the linear and the nonlinear analyses are applied to a specific natural circulation loop geometry, namely the Horizontal Heater Horizontal Cooler (HHHC) one. In this regard, an Object-Oriented (O-O) one-dimensional model of the HHHC loop is developed. For the assessment of the O-O model, the obtained results are compared with RELAP5 and Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) time-dependent simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
2	0	33	Psychology  	 Prejudice  	 HIV; HIV positive; general public; attitudes; knowledge        	The overarching objective of this article is to describe the Swedish public's knowledge about HIV and attitudes toward people living with HIV during the period 1987-2011. Within the framework of this objective, the article also directs a special focus at the association between knowledge about HIV transmission and attitudes toward people who are HIV positive. The study is based on the results of a questionnaire sent to a stratified random sample on eight occasions between 1987 and 2011. The study population comprises the Swedish general public aged 16-44 and is stratified on the basis of the respondents' age, with each of five age groups (16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-34, and 35-44) comprising 20% of the study respondents. A total of 21,027 individuals have completed the questionnaire in the eight surveys. The survey instrument is relatively short and comprises 27 questions on knowledge, attitudes and sexual behaviour relating to HIV. The eight surveys show that the public's knowledge about HIV and its different transmission routes is high and has increased over time. Above all there has been an increase in the level of knowledge about how HIV is not transmitted between people. However, the public's knowledge about the infectiousness of individuals receiving treatment for HIV infection is low. Public attitudes toward people with HIV have also undergone a clear shift over time, toward increased tolerance and a decline in the level of fear, especially in social situations. Despite this, a residual suspicion and stigmatisation can be seen in the public's attitudes to people who are HIV positive. This is most obvious from the questions that link HIV to sexuality and here the changes are very modest over time. Public knowledge about HIV and its transmission routes has increased between 1987 and 2011. Attitudes toward people who are HIV positive have generally become more tolerant and positive, not least in relation to different social situations. The fear of becoming infected has declined. At the same time there remains a stigma, which continues to direct suspicion at people who are living with HIV and to ascribe them negative characteristics and behaviors that are based on prejudice. The results show, however, that the public's attitudes toward same-sex relationships are clearly more accepting today than they were previously, and that the symbolic association between HIV and this group is tending to become weaker.

The automotive industry has turned to the electrically powered vehicle owing to the problems caused by gasoline engine on people as well as the environment. This paper explains how an electric vehicle works and compares the electric vehicle to the internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicle. Also it proposes the optimum way to use the power which can be recovered through regenerative braking for charging the battery.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 Fluid-structure interaction; Hydraulic arresting gear; Isogeometric analysis; Parametric design; NURBS; Hydrodynamic loading        	Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis of a full-scale hydraulic arresting gear used to retard the forward motion of an aircraft landing on an aircraft-carrier deck is performed. The simulations make use of the recently developed core and special-purpose FSI techniques for other problem classes, specialized to the present application. A recently proposed interactive geometry modeling and parametric design platform for isogeometric analysis (IGA) is directly employed to create the arresting gear model, and illustrates a natural application of IGA to this problem class. The fluid mechanics and FSI simulation results are reported in terms of the arresting-gear rotor loads and blade structural deformation and vibration. Excellent agreement is achieved with the experimental results for the arresting gear design simulated in this work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
3	7	59	MAE 	 Materials Engineering  	 Information and Communication Technology (ICT); Technology Integration; implementation; Teaching Skill; Digital Environments        	In this work, surveys to students of Materials Engineering were carried out so as to evaluate different aspects of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in their studying habits and their willingness to incorporate new tools. Based on data collection different trends were detected concerning the use of resources and the interest in the incorporation of new instruments which would facilitate studying. Most students (76%) from the basic courses (first two years of the career) did not show any interest to incorporate new technological resources when studying. However, all students from the upper courses (last three years) were in favor of this proposal. In the same way, students from the upper courses use technological resources, which are more advanced and, many times, these are related to their professional activity. They also possess information regarding the existence of resources to work online. Based on this field study, we propose to incorporate new technological resources into the teaching methodology systematically and progressively throughout the course of studies. This proposal considers the use of a free-access and free of charge tool, Google+, in four progressive levels. The global evaluation of the proposal is not immediate since there is the need to follow the evolution of a cohort in which the progressive utilization is implemented. This process takes at least five years. Nevertheless, the proposal would help teachers/professors and students to carry out their specific tasks inside and outside University.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible correlation between ""Small World"" characteristics of the brain connectivity architecture-as extracted from EEG recordings-and hippocampal volume in AD patients. A dataset of 144 subjects, including 110 AD (MMSE 21.3) and 34 healthy Nold (MMSE 29.8) individuals, was evaluated. Weighted and undirected networks were built by the eLORETA solutions of the cortical sources' activities moving from EEG recordings. The evaluation of the hippocampal volume was carried out on a subgroup of 60 AD patients who received a high-resolution T1-weighted sequence and underwent processing for surface-based cortex reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using the Freesurfer image analysis software. Results showed that, quantitatively, more correlation was observed in the right hemisphere, but the same trend was seen in both hemispheres. Alpha band connectivity was negatively correlated, while slow (delta) and fast-frequency (beta, gamma) bands positively correlated with hippocampal volume. Namely, the larger the hippocampal volume, the lower the alpha and the higher the delta, beta, and gamma Small World characteristics of connectivity. Accordingly, the Small World connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection."

Patients & methods: DNA methylation was quantified in T-lymphocytes from 46 treatment-naive patients using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Treatment response was determined in 6 months using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Results: Initial filtering identified 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) that were differentially methylated between responders and nonresponders. After conservative adjustment for multiple testing, six sites remained statistically significant, of which four showed high sensitivity and/or specificity (>= 75%) for response to treatment. Moreover, methylation at two sites in combination was the strongest factor associated with response (80.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, AUC 0.85). Conclusion: DNA methylation at diagnosis is associated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment response in early RA.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 Catheterization    Peripheral; Embolism and Thrombosis; Peripheral Arterial Disease       	Background: Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a clinical entity with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances and variety of its management, there is still no criterion standard treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of tirofiban use on the early and 6-month prognosis of patients with knee and below-knee arterial thrombosis who were treated with percutaneous thrombosuction (PT) within 24 h. Material/Methods: Data of consecutive ALI patients who were diagnosed with popliteal and infra-popliteal arterial thrombosis and underwent PT procedure within 24 h between January 2010 and September 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to tirofiban usage. Results: A total of 105 patients (mean age 67 +/- 16; 53% men) were included in the study. Atrial fibrillation (n 64, 61%) and hypertension (n 60, 57%) were the most frequent comorbidities in patients with thromboembolic events. A significantly higher rate of distal embolization (6% vs. 16%; p=0.01) and slow-flow (17% vs. 30%; p<0.01) developed in patients who were not treated with tirofiban after the PT procedure. Although major and minor bleeding were more frequent in the tirofiban group, only the rate minor bleeding was statistically significant (29% vs. 9%, p=0.001). Reverse embolic event ratio was similar in both groups. Although there was a higher rate of amputation in patients not treated with tirofiban, the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Adding tirofiban to PT reduces angiographic thromboembolic complications. Usage of tirofiban in patients prone to thromboembolic events may be useful for improving success of the PT procedure, with a reasonable bleeding ratio.

A safe data transmission requires integrity, availability and privacy protection features as well as efficient communication in diverse settings. Recently proposed security protocols for vehicular communication cannot authenticate in a complex way in areas of heavy traffic due to the increasing number of messages in proportion to the number of vehicles. For efficient communication, data volume need be reduced and communication should be safe against a range of attacks. Hence, the present paper proposes a protocol that accelerates message processing by sending a low data volume for communication in areas of heavy traffic and that blocks replay attacks by checking timestamps. In addition, CASPER/FDR (Lowe in Casper: a compiler for the analysis of security protocols. User Manual and Tutorial, Version 1.12, 2009; Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd in Failures-Divergence Renement. FDR2 user manual, 2010) is used to verify the proposed protocol for its security and efficiency against any security vulnerabilities.

""T-shaped"" professionals, i.e. individuals with a depth and breadth of expertise, are being called upon to play a critical role in complex problem-solving. This paper unpacks the notion of the ""T-shaped expert"" and seeks to situate it within the broader academic literature on expertise, integration, and developmental learning. A component of this project includes an exploratory study, which is aimed at evaluating the emergent attributes of T-shaped expertise in two different educational programs completed between January and May in 2015. The two programs build disciplinary knowledge in science, technology engineering, and mathematics fields at the core (vertical dimension), while expanding the students' awareness and comprehension of other expertise (horizontal dimension). The courses introduced science and engineering students to case study topics focusing around complex human-technological-ecological systems in a nanotechnology and society course; and the governance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a science, technology, and society course. We analyze pre- and post-test data from this pilot project before presenting findings that pertain to student learning, as well as variants in the methodology and reflect on the utility (and limitations) of the selected methodology for evaluating expertise as it evolves over time. The paper closes with a discussion of a theory of acquisition with implications for delineating early attributes and characteristics of T-shaped expertise."

This requires, on the one hand, an infrastructure for simulating the physical environment and, on the other hand, an infrastructure for emulating the Ambient Assisted Living devices. Both can be interconnected through data streams that allow emulated devices to behave as if they were connected to the real world, since they get similar sensor input. This paper introduces advances on a simulation framework for ambient intelligence so that it becomes capable of producing such data streams.

However, dermatoses afflicting chronic alcoholics figure in a few studies only. Aim: This study aims to correlate the spectrum of dermatoses in chronic alcoholics with the quantum/duration of alcohol intake and raised liver transaminases. Materials and Methods: Adult males, totaling 196, ascertained to fulfill the Royal College of Psychiatry criteria for chronic alcoholism by the de -addiction center and referred for dermatological consult were enrolled as cases, and similar number of age -/sex -matched teetotallers, as controls. Data emanating from detailed history, clinical examination, and routine liver functions tests were summarized and subsequently analyzed, including statistically using the Chi-square, independent ""t"" and Spearman's rank correlation tests, and compared with data from previous studies. Results: Majority (104) drank 41-50 units of alcohol/week since 3-40 (mean: 20.01 +/- 9.322) years. Generalized pruritus (odds ratio [OR]: 31.15, P < 0.001), xerosis (OR: 3.62, P = 0.008), and seborrheic dermatitis (OR: 12.26, P < 0.001) were significantly more common in cases than controls. Infections (73; 37.2%), eczemas (45; 22.9%), and generalized hyperpigmentation (28; 14.2%) were- the major presenting complaints. Spider nevi, gynecomastia, and pellagroid dermatitis were present in 34 (17.3%), 19 (9.7%), and 8 (4.1%) respectively exclusively in cases only. Commonly seen systemic abnormalities were an alcoholic liver disease (45; 22.9%), diabetes mellitus (23; 11.7%), and peripheral neuropathy (19; 9.7%). Conclusion: Knowledge of cutaneous manifestations of chronic alcoholism could prompt in-depth history taking of alcohol intake, lead to specialist referral and thereby enable timely de -addiction, hopefully before serious adversities in the chronic alcoholics."

As expected, both clinical groups performed worse than the control group in executive functions and emotional intelligence, although the impairment was greater in the borderline personality disorder group. Executive functions significantly correlated with social functioning. Results are discussed in relation to the brain circuits that mediate executive functions and emotional intelligence and the findings obtained with other models of social cognition.

1	2	19	ECE 	 Electrical circuits  	 Microwave photonics; Modeling; Simulation and characterizations of devices and circuits        	Wireless domestic applications involving high data rates are required to work on millimeter wave band. Signal propagation at this frequency range is affected by walls and oxygen absorption which limits communication distances to few meters in one room. Radio coverage can be extended to other rooms by optical links. Performances of such photonic systems are dependent on optoelectronic devices, electrical driving, and receiver circuits. In this paper, radio-over-fiber (RoF) links based on the intensity modulation and direct detection technique are investigated for transmission of a broadband OFDM signal. Direct and external modulations are exploited to analyze system performances according to the ultra wideband (UWB) millimeter-band standard. To avoid component tolerances at high frequencies, an intermediate frequency modulation of the optical transducers is chosen. Optoelectronic and optical components of RoF links are modeled by equivalent electrical circuits with consideration of noise and nonlinearities. These models are validated in system simulation by error vector magnitude evaluation with a measurement setup according to the UWB centimeter-band standard.

A total of 456 patients categorised into two groups according to age: group 1 (n = 158) (39 years) and group 2 (n = 298) (< 39 years) were analysed retrospectively. In addition, subgroup analysis was performed according to the 40 years cut-off. Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly different between the groups (p < .001). Preterm delivery (< 37 gestational week) and low birth weight (< 2500 g) were significantly higher in advanced aged women than youngsters (p < .001). Mean expense per cycle for hormonal stimulation of IVF-ICSI was 1058.9 and 723.5 USD in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < .001). Mean expense per pregnancy was 9294.7 and 1874.8 USD in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < .001). Our study showed that perinatal outcomes and cost-effectivity might be adversely affected with increasing age.

0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Smart heating control; Fuzzy inference system; Artificial neural network; Energy and control effectiveness; Climate zone        	This paper compares smart control models for heating supply air among five different climate conditions to discuss the effectiveness of machine learning tools in terms of control and energy efficiency. A thermostat on/off control is typically used to maintain room temperature at a desired level. Advanced computing technologies have recently been introduced to complement the conventional on/off controls to improve control efficiency in heating systems. However, these methods, which were mostly utilized to control fuel amount or fan motor speed, lacked the capability to promptly respond to various outdoor temperature conditions as climate zones requiring refined control strategies to reduce environmental impacts. This paper proposes intelligent controls of mass and temperature simultaneously for heating air supply. The Fuzzy inference System (FIS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms are utilized to develop six control models, and the models are tested to evaluate both control and energy efficiency during the winter season in five climate zones (from climate zone 2 through 6; i.e., Houston, Dallas, Raleigh, Chicago, and Detroit, respectively). Results include the energy consumption, control errors, and control signals in comparison to the baseline on/off control, which confirms the fact that the ANN simultaneous controls of mass and temperature is more effective than the other controllers for control accuracy and energy savings by 71.3% and 03%, respectively. The effectiveness of the ANN controller can contribute to maintaining room temperature accompanying the reduction of energy consumption, which is directly related to improve human comfort and reduce environmental impacts in various climate zones.

2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 IDF; mission command; optional command        	Mission command is a command philosophy that denotes decentralized leadership; it is a philosophy of command that requires and facilitates initiative in all levels of command and encourages subordinates to exploit opportunities by empowering them to demonstrate initiative and exercise personal judgement. In its first decades of existence, military analysts portrayed the Israeli command system as such and termed it optional control'. The primary objective of this article is to explore the rise and decline of optional control' in the IDF. The first part of the article follows the development of optional control in the IDF's first decades of existence until the 1970s. The second part of the paper will describe its decline through the analysis of command in recent IDF military campaigns. The last part is analysis; explanation for the decline in mission command is attributed to four major factors: the changes in Israel's society and thereof in civilmilitary relations; the changes in character of military operations; the lack of appropriate military education; and the role and impact of new technologies on the IDF. The combined effect of these factors impedes the ongoing efforts of the IDF to re-establish mission command as its preferred command philosophy.

The conferences will be related to the last advances in composite materials and the more relevant companies of this sector will be present in two of the plenary sessions and in stands."
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 Energy harvesting; Vibration analysis; Smart materials; Nonlinear analysis        	In this article, a conceptual design with its architecture of a broadband, vibration-based, nonlinear energy harvester is reported. Its non-linear behavior and its functionality are presented. Compared to that provided by conventional linear beam type of energy harvesters, this nonlinear harvester can provide widen the resonance frequency ranges. Hence, it can collect more vibration energy generated at various dominant rotational frequencies of a rotary machine. A smart material, called Magneto Rheological Elastomer (MRE), was added to the usual beam structured energy harvester. Since MRE is one of the magnetic smart materials, of which their stiffness can be tuned by precisely controlling the applied magnetic field, the stiffness of the combined piezoelectric beam with MRE becomes adjustable. Because of the adjustable stiffness, the resonance frequency of the new beam type energy harvester can be adaptively changed to match with a particular dominant rotational frequency generated by the monitored machine so that maximum vibration energy can be harvested. Moreover, due to the nonlinearity of the new composite beam structure, the range of resonance frequency range can be widened to make it easier to adapt a slightly varying dominant rotational frequency due to the monitored machine has small speed variation. Besides the presentation of design and its with its architecture in the article, the simulated and experimental results of the new non-linear harvester are also reported here. From the comparison study of the bandwidth and the output power generated by the new nonlinear energy harvester against that generated from conventional harvester, the result shows that new non-linear harvester is functioning superior to that of the conventional harvesters.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Cinnamomum longepaniculatum; Northern blot; Prokaryotic expression; Southern blot; Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase        	The stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) is a key enzyme that determines the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in higher plants. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends, a full-length cDNA of SAD was obtained from developing leaves of Cinnamomum longepaniculatum. Sequence analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequence had high similarity to other reported SADs. The CSAD gene was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the desaturating activity of the recombinant protein was markedly detected when assayed in vitro by adding spinach ferredoxin. Southern blot analysis indicated that the gene was a member of a small gene family. Northern blotting revealed that the CSAD gene was highly expressed in developing leaves of C. longepaniculatum. These results would provide opportunities for modifying fatty acid composition in C. longepaniculatum.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 atherosclerosis; immunology; inflammation; lymphocytes; ultraviolet rays        	Objective-UVB irradiation is an established treatment for immunoinflammatory cutaneous disorders and has been shown to suppress cutaneous and systemic inflammatory diseases through modulation of the adaptive immune response. However, it remains unknown whether UVB irradiation prevents an immunoinflammatory disease of arteries such as atherosclerosis. Approach and Results-Here, we show that UVB exposure inhibits the development and progression of atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone mice by expanding and enhancing the functional capacity of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells and regulating proatherogenic T-cell responses. Experimental studies in Langerhans cell-depleted mice revealed that epidermal Langerhans cells play a critical role in UVB-dependent induction of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells, suppression of proatherogenic T-cell responses, and prevention of atherosclerotic plaque development. Conclusions-Our findings suggest the skin immune system as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and provide a novel strategy for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.
1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 Analog signal processing; CMOS; Multistage amplifier; Passive compensation; Negative capacitance; Flipped voltage follower        	This paper presents a new and compact two stage CMOS structure with enhanced gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and high slew rate. The frequency compensation technique employed here comprises of a negative capacitance cell and a flipped voltage follower (FVF). The use of negative capacitance lowers the parasitic capacitance of preceding stage and thereby achieves significant improvement in GBW. The FVF acts as a voltage buffer and exploits pole-zero cancellation technique. The required compensation capacitor is very small so it can save chip area. The workability of the proposed circuit has been verified by using Mentor Graphics Eldo simulation tool with TSMC CMOS 0.18 A mu m process parameters. The simulated results show a GBW of 1.2 GHz and average slew rate of 88 V/A mu s with a power consumption of 6.3 mW.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Adolescents; Birthweight; Gestational age; Race; Communication        	Study Objective: To examine how parent-child relationships, parental control, and parental attitudes towards sex were related to pregnancy outcomes among adolescent mothers. Design: Prospective cohort study. Parental report of relationship satisfaction, disapproval of adolescent having sex, discussion around sexual health, and sexual communication attitudes, and adolescent report of relationship satisfaction, parental control, and parental disapproval of sex were examined as predictors of self-reported birth outcomes. Weighted multivariable linear regression models were run incorporating interactions by race. Setting: United States. Participants: 632 females who participated in Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally-representative sample of students enrolled in grades 7-12 in 1994-95 and followed up in 2007-2008. Main Outcome Measures: Birthweight and gestational age. Results: For Black adolescents, better parent-child relationship was associated with higher birthweight (0.14 kg, P < .05) and gestational age (0.75 weeks, P < .01), while higher parental disapproval of having sex (adjusted beta 0.15 kg, P < .05) were associated with higher birthweight. For non-Black adolescents, a moderate amount of discussion of birth control was associated with higher birthweight (0.19 kg, P < .01 and lower child-perceived parental disapproval of having sex was associated with higher birthweight (0.08 kg, P < .05) and gestational age (0.37 weeks, P < .05). Higher parental control was associated with a reduced likelihood of smoking during pregnancy and a greater likelihood of early prenatal care. Conclusion: Parent-child relationships and attitudes about sex affect outcomes of pregnant adolescents.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 Menopause; Bone mineral density; Transdermal estrogen        	Due to its minimal systematic adverse effects, transdermal estrogen is widely used for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The present meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effects of transdermal estrogen on bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases including Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and also the Sciences Citation Index. Systematic review of articles was published between January 1989 to February 2016. Reference lists of the included articles were also evaluated and consultations were made with relevant experts. While 132 studies included the desired keywords, only nine clinical trials met the inclusion criteria and were finally reviewed. The pooled percent change in BMD was statistically significant in favor of transdermal estrogen. According to resulting pooled estimate, lumbar spine BMD one and two years after transdermal estrogen therapy was respectively 3.4% (95% CI: 1.7-5.1) and 3.7% (95% CI: 1.7-5.7) higher than the baseline values. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant based on the I-2 heterogeneity index. One-two years of transdermal estrogen delivery can effectively increase BMD and protect the bone structure in postmenopausal women.
3	8	60	MAE 	 Strength of materials  	 Residual stresses; Hole drilling method; Laser welded lap joint; Heat affected zone        	Residual stresses deteriorate strength of materials affecting the quality of industrial products. A removal or reduction of the residual stresses is an essential procedure in successful engineering component development. Effective and convenient methods are necessary for detection and evaluation of residual stresses. In this paper Hole Drilling Method is chosen for identification and a quantitative determination of the residual stresses in specimens of two groups under different laser welding speed conditions, 4.1m/min and 5.1m/min. The lap joints welded with STS 301L sheet of two different speeds were investigated along the welding line at two locations, the middle and the end location in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The identification of HAZ is carried out by taking hardness values from weld centerline to the raw material. Based on the experimental results and analysis, it is found that higher welding speed reduces the residual stresses. Also, the end location is found to be higher residual stress area compared with middle location due to the convective boundary condition. The residual stresses decrease as the depth increases from the top surface due to the lower heat input to depth increments.
4	9	70	Civil 	 Construction Management  	 history; planning & scheduling; project management        	Among alternative scheduling techniques in construction management are linear and repetitive scheduling and line of balance (LOB). They are uniquely different from the dominant network-based technique because they have been developed for projects with repetitive units of work and crew operations. Notably, they feature quantitative measures of both work and time, which no network-based approach offers. However, a study of their origins - for example, the US Navy - reveals that their original use and capabilities deviate from current application, which is limited at best. Indeed, currently, the name-giving LOB is itself omitted. Therefore, this research has the goal to explore these scheduling techniques in detail. Its objectives are to delineate their modelling elements as described by original sources in a structured manner, to compare them in detail and identify any changes over time and to comment on implications for practical use and extract unsolved research questions. Its methodology follows a comparative research approach. Differences are found in how productivity and cyclic crew deployment are expressed, besides the glaring omission of the LOB itself in the construction use of this method. It is found that, historically, LOB was intended for manufacturing, but when introduced to construction, important characteristics of the production plan and progress chart became forgotten. In parallel, linear scheduling was developed for construction, whose similarities to LOB may have added confusion. Clarifying the complete methods by explicitly outlining their analytical capabilities will improve understanding to allow project managers to benefit from these powerful tools. It also enables future research to model LOB with singularity functions to yield a unified formulation of these alternative scheduling techniques.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Membrane distillation; Flat sheep membrane; Shale gas; Flowback water; Produced water; Scale formation        	Although shale gas has become an important source of natural gas, it has problems associated with water pollution by producing high salinity wastewater (i.e. TDS>100,000mg/L). Membrane distillation (MD) can be applied to treat such wastewater but may suffer from fouling due to scale formation. Accordingly, this study focused on the use of antiscalants to retard scale formation in MD process for the treatment of high salinity wastewater. Experiments were performed using a laboratory-scale direct contact MD (DCMD) system. Seven different antiscalants were applied to the simplified synthetic wastewater. The results were analyzed using a simple theoretical model. It was found that the abilities to retard scale formation were different for different antiscalants. The difference in chemical structures of the antiscalants was attributed to the changes in their effect on scale prevention. Moreover, the mechanisms of flux decline seem to be different in the presence of antiscalants. Not only surface blockage but also internal pore blocking occurred during the MD operation, and the dominant fouling mechanism changed by the addition of the antiscalants.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Analog front-end; charge amplifier; continuous-time delta-sigma ADC; environmental sensor; instrumentation amplifier; weak inversion        	An analog front-end (AFE) for a multifunction environmental sensor is proposed. The AFE is designed to be able to sense 1 mu V, 1 fC, and 1 pA level signals in a low-frequency band around DC, and consists of an instrumentation amplifier (IA), a charge amplifier (CA), and a continuous time delta-sigma (CT-Delta Sigma) ADC. To reduce the low-frequency noise of operational amplifier (OPAMP) which is used for signal path, this paper proposes a weak-inversion biasing technique. The designed IA achieved 26 nVrms input-referred noise (IRN) in the band of 0.1-10 Hz with 0.22 mm(2) die area. The designed CA achieved 25 aCrms IRN in charge sensing mode and 19 fArms IRN in current sensing mode in the band of 0.01-1 Hz, respectively, and occupies 0.12 mm(2) die area. The AFE has been fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process with 4.5 mm(2) die area. The current consumption at 2.56 kHz output data rate (ODR) is 2.5 mA, reducing to 2 mu A at 0.01 Hz ODR.
5	12	84	Medical 	 Children's Health  	 Asthma; Birth cohort; Oral contraceptives; Rhinitis; Wheeze        	Background: The prevalence of maternal oral contraceptive pills (OCP) use and that of childhood asthma are high in western countries. The aim of this study is to examine the association of OCP use with childhood wheeze and allergic diseases in Japan. Methods: Relevant data were extracted from a hospital based birth cohort study named as Tokyo-Children's Health, Illness and Development Study (T-CHILD) of which questionnaire conducted during pregnancy included maternal history and duration of OCP use. To identify wheeze and allergic diseases in the children, the questionnaire of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was used. Logistic regression models were applied to estimate those association and adjustments were made for maternal history of allergy, maternal education level, maternal age at pregnancy, maternal BMI, maternal smoking during pregnancy, mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery, daycare attendance, number of previous live births, and gender of child. Results: OCP use was associated with ever wheeze (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.40), current wheeze (aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.50), ever asthma (aOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.02-2.65), and ever rhinitis (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.30-2.80). Compared with no prior OCP use, using OCP for more than three months statistically increased the odds of ever wheeze (P = 0.012), current wheeze (P = 0.035), and ever rhinitis (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that maternal OCP use has a role in the development of wheeze, asthma and rhinitis in children. Extended use of OCP is likely to increase the risk of wheeze and rhinitis. Copyright (C) 2016, Japanese Society of Allergology.
2	3	36	Psychology  	 Nonverbal communication  	 power; emotion recognition accuracy; interpersonal sensitivity; leadership        	Whether superiors or subordinates are more accurate in assessing the emotions of others (aka emotion recognition accuracy, ERA) is a question that has gained much interest but yielded decidedly mixed empirical results. The present study investigates whether superiors and subordinates who are in an actual hierarchical relationship differ in their ERA. We investigated 142 superiors who each had recruited one of his or her direct subordinates (total N = 284). Superiors and subordinates each took a paper-pencil version of a standardized ERA test. Results showed that superiors were more accurate in assessing the emotions of other persons than subordinates were.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Expert systems; image classification; image colour analysis; image texture analysis; machine vision        	The objective of this study is to create computer vision algorithms for autonomous multiclass identification of amber nuggets by their colour. By applying the proposed methods an automated production sorting system has been developed. This system can be used, for example in combination with conveyor systems, and in any other case that requires distinguishing objects of many classes in a high-rate flow of objects. In order to achieve this, the proposed system operates with colour features selection, algorithm for classifier training, grouping, and voting with reject option have been developed. The developed system has been used in an automated amber sorting line to increase the quantities of sorted amber nuggets. The applied algorithms gave 88.21% as the highest accuracy for the amber nugget expert database consisting of 30 classes.
5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 Mental health; psychological distress; social networks; social isolation; social connection        	Background: Although mental health (MH) is overall strongly associated with psychological distress (PD), this association is very weak for the sample with high PD. This relationship remains understudied. Aim: This study examines the association between MH and PD and whether this association is mediated by social network (SN) factors for individuals with high PD. Method: Data were taken from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study (N=756). MH was measured using the MH sub-scale of the general health survey (Short Form (SF)-36) and PD was measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The SN measures were derived from the self-completion questionnaire. Using bootstrap mediation analysis, we tested whether the association between MH and PD is mediated by SN factors. Result: The correlation between MH and PD was r=-.410 (p<.001). The mediational analysis results show that social isolation mediates the association between MH and PD with an indirect effect of =-0.0070 (confidence interval (CI)=-0.0133 to -0.0023). Moreover, social connections also mediated the association between MH and PD with an indirect effect of =-0.0073 (CI=-0.0141 to -0.0028). Conclusion: This study has practical implications for the design of social policies that attempt to reduce social isolation and enhance social connectedness to protect MH.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Sultanina; water transport; plasma membrane intrinsic protein; tonoplast intrinsic protein; PIP; TIP        	In grapevine, berry growth after veraison is paralleled by a notable intake of water and sugar. Our results show that in 'Sultanina', a seedless variety, this intake is significantly improved by gibberellic acid (GA(3)), which is normally sprayed to get a commercial berry size. As at this stage the pedicel xylem functionality is lost, it is presumed that water transport occurs via the phloem. This implies a possible role of water channels in cell membranes (aquaporins). Two complementary approaches were used to evaluate the effect of GA(3) on the expression of aquaporin genes. In the first one, PIP and TIP probes derived from 'Sultanina' cloned amplicons and ESTs were used for Northern blotting. Results from these experiments showed that there was not a uniform type of response, with some genes exhibiting a more intense expression at early developmental stages than at veraison, and others showing a lower expression difference. In second place, we confirmed a possible role for GA controlling PIP/TIP gene expression, but again, the results were quite diverse in terms of timing and level of response to the hormonal treatment. In spite of this diversity, a tendency to maintain a higher expression level during post-veraison in GA(3)-treated plants was observed. Microarray hybridizations showed a heterogeneous response to GA-treatment for different genes of the aquaporin family. However, these last experiments must be considered preliminary, both because of technical issues, mainly the requirement of a better reproducibility level, and because of pre-veraison being the developmental stage when one of the lowest levels of aquaporin genes expression was observed.
5	38	110	Medical 	 Cancer  	 Lipid peroxidation; Antioxidant enzymes; Breast cancer; Urtica Dioica; N-methyl-N-nitrosourea        	Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.,) is a medicinal herb commonly used by humans. The role of reactive oxygen metabolites on cancer etiology is known. There are some studies about the antioxidant effects of Urtica Dioica (UD) on therapy of some cancer types. This study aimed to investigate the effects of UD on antioxidant enzyme activities and mammary gland cancer induced by in rats-N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (NMU) carcinogenesis. Rats were divided into four groups: a untreated group (Group 1), a NMU group (Group 2) given 50 mg/kg NMU by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, a NMU group (Group 3) treated with UD, a control group (Group 4) fed with 50g/kg UD. After 5.5 months, rats were decapitated, and mammary tissue and blood samples were obtained. There was a significant (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively) increase in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of group 2 compared with group 1 and 4. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of the erythrocytes was decreased in group 3 than the other groups (p<0.0001). The erythrocyte catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased in group 4 compared with group 2 and 3 (p<0.05, p<0.01, respectively). The number of animals with palpable tumors was 6 (46.15%) in group 2, and 2 (13.3%) in group 3 at the end of the 22nd week. Although group 3 had lower palpable tumor number than group 2, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.096). The results showed that UD constituents may have effects on lipid peroxidation and some antioxidant enzyme activities, and may slow the formation of mammary tumor.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 cytokines; interleukins; matrix metalloproteinases; fibrosis        	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade collagen and mediate tissue remodeling. The novel cytokine IL-17 is expressed during various inflammatory conditions and modulates MMP expression. We investigated the effect of IL-17 on MMP-1 expression in primary human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF) and delineated the signaling pathways involved. HCF were treated with recombinant human IL-17. MMP-1 expression was analyzed by Northern blotting, RT-quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA; transcriptional induction and transcription factor binding by EMSA, ELISA, and reporter assay; and p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 activation by protein kinase assays and Western blotting. Signal transduction pathways were investigated using pharmacological inhibitors, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and adenoviral dominant-negative expression vectors. IL-17 stimulated MMP-1 gene transcription, net mRNA levels, protein, and promoter-reporter activity in HCF. This response was blocked by IL-17 receptor- Fc chimera and IL-17 receptor antibodies, but not by IL-6, TNF-alpha, or IL-1 beta antibodies. IL-17-stimulated type I collagenase activity was inhibited by the MMP inhibitor GM-6001 and by siRNA-mediated MMP-1 knockdown. IL-17 stimulated activator protein-1 [AP-1 (c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1)], NF-kappa B (p50 and p65), and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-beta DNA binding and reporter gene activities, effects attenuated by antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA-mediated knockdown, or expression of dominant-negative signaling proteins. Inhibition of AP-1, NF-kappa B, or C/EBP activation attenuated IL-17-stimulated MMP-1 expression. IL-17 induced p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 activation, and inhibition by SB-203580 and PD-98059 blunted IL-17-mediated transcription factor activation and MMP-1 expression. Our data indicate that IL-17 induces MMP-1 in human cardiac fibroblasts directly via p38 MAPK- and ERK-dependent AP-1, NF-kappa B, and C/EBP-beta activation and suggest that IL-17 may play a critical role in myocardial remodeling.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 adolescent; AiMu Mcu; intrauterine device; laparoscopy; uterine perforation        	Intrauterine devices (IUD) are the most common method of reversible birth control used worldwide. Adolescents infrequently have uterine perforation caused by IUD, hampering both the diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we report a case of uterine perforation in an 18-year-old primipara after insertion of an IUD that possessed memory function (AiMu MCu). The patient presented with vomiting and abdominal pain after insertion of an AiMu MCu IUD, was treated via laparoscopy and had a full recovery. The present case indicated that uterine perforation caused by an AiMu MCu IUD may occur as a rare complication and that uterine perforation can occur in an adolescent. Clinicians might consider a diagnosis of uterine perforation in an adolescent reporting vomiting and abdominal pain after IUD insertion. Laparoscopy could be a reasonable treatment option for such patients.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Kernel principal components analysis; Kernel methods; Online kernel algorithms; Machine learning; Generalized Hebbian algorithm        	The online extraction of kernel principal components has gained increased attention, and several algorithms proposed recently explore kernelized versions of the generalized Hebbian algorithm (GHA) [1], a well-known principal component analysis (PCA) extraction rule. Corisequently, the convergence speed of such algorithms and the accuracy of the extracted components are highly dependent on a proper choice of the learning rate, a problem dependent factor. This paper proposes a new online fixed-point kerriel principal component extraction algorithm, exploring the minimization of a recursive least-square error function, conjugated with an approximated deflation transform using component estimates obtained by the algorithm, implicitly applied upon data. The proposed technique automatically builds a concise dictionary to expand kernel components, involves simple recursive equations to dynamically define a specific learning rate to each component under extraction, and has a linear computational complexity regarding dictionary size. As compared to state-of-art kernel principal component extraction algorithms, results show improved convergence speed and accuracy of the components produced by the proposed method in five open-access databases.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 Health disparities; Access to care; Nurse practitioner; NP practice regulatory; Population health        	Background: Health disparities persist among morbidity and mortality rates in the United States. Contributing significantly to these disparities are the ability to pay for health care (largely, access to health insurance) and access to, and capacity of, the primary care health workforce. Purpose: This article examines key determinants of health (DOH) including demographics, public and regulatory policies, health workforce capacity, and primary health outcomes of four states of the United States. The context of this study is the potential association among health care disparities and myriad DOH, among them, the restrictive nurse practitioner (NP) scope of practice (SOP) regulatory environment, which are documented to influence access to care and health outcomes. Methods: This descriptive study explores current NP SOP regulations, access to primary care, and health outcomes of key chronic disease indicators diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, and Utah. These states represent both the greatest disparity in chronic disease health outcomes (obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) and the greatest difference in modernization of their NP SOP laws. The Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded access to health care. However, it is estimated that 23 million Americans, 7% of its total population, will remain uninsured by 2019. Discussion: Restrictive and inconsistent NP SOP policies may continue to contribute to health workforce capacity and population health disparities across the country, with particular concern for primary care indicators. The study findings bring into question whether states with more restrictive NP SOP regulations impact access to primary care, which may in turn influence population health outcomes. These findings suggest the need for further research. NPs are essential for meeting the increasing demands of primary care in the United States, and quality-of-care indicator research supports their use.
1	13	30	ECE 	 State space representation  	 State space model; Linear graph; Model extraction; Power conversion unit; Brayton cycle        	This second paper in a two part series presents the application of a developed state space model extraction methodology applied to a Brayton cycle-based PCU (power conversion unit) of a PBMR (pebble bed modular reactor). The goal is to investigate if the state space extraction methodology can cope with larger and more complex thermohydraulic systems. In Part I the state space model extraction methodology for the purpose of control was described in detail and a state space representation was extracted for a U-tube system to illustrate the concept. In this paper a 25th order nonlinear state space representation in terms of the different energy domains is extracted. This state space representation is solved and the responses of a number of important states are compared with results obtained from a PBMR PCU Flownex (R) model. Flownex (R) is a validated thermo fluid simulation software package. The results show that the state space model closely resembles the dynamics of the PBMR PCU. This kind of model may be used for nonlinear MIMO (multi-input, multi-output) type of control strategies. However, there is still a need for linear state space models since many control system design and analysis techniques require a linear state space model. This issue is also addressed in this paper by showing how a linear state space model can be derived from the extracted nonlinear state space model. The linearised state space model is also validated by comparing the state space model to an existing linear Simulink (R) model of the PBMR PCU system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 Process control; EMSO; Dynamic simulation; Block-oriented modeling        	Process control courses usually have a section of the course focused on the building of block diagrams for modeling, simulation, and analysis of open and closed loop processes. For this purpose, students are often oriented to build models using SIMULINK or XCOS because of the versatility of these powerful tools in the easy construction of mathematical models using the concept of block-oriented programming. In this paper we propose a model library built in the software EMSO that allows the user to create block diagrams for process control studies. EMSO is a powerful tool for process modeling, dynamic simulation and optimization, freely available for academic purpose. With the developed library, analysis of systems responses, even for complex processes, can be carried out and PID controller tuning tasks are made easier and less time-consuming to the students, allowing them to advance in the study of more complex control strategies such as ratio, cascade, override, feed forward, among others. Students valued the developed tool as a very useful and practical one to favor a control course learning process and between equivalent and advantageous tool when compared with SIMULINK and XCOS.

2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 coping strategy; multiple sclerosis; MS; psychosocial adjustment        	BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with significant psychosocial adjustment challenges. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the psychosocial adjustment and coping strategies in patients with MS and to put forth the relationships between them. DESIGN: The sample group comprised 85 outpatients with MS who were admitted to the Neurology Clinic of a university hospital for treatment between October 2007 and July 2008. Data were acquired via an information form and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale and Coping Strategy Indicator. RESULTS: It was determined that 55% of the patients had poor psychosocial adjustment levels. Statistically significant relationship was found between Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report and problem solving as well as seeking social support coping strategies (p < .01). Psychosocial adjustment got worse with decreasing problem-solving and seeking-social support coping strategies of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial adjustment to MS of patients is closely related with effective coping strategies. The results have emphasized the significant role of mental health and social services and coping strategies regarding the comprehensive care needs of these patients.

Diagnosed individuals undergo long-term lithium therapy which has proven to be effective for mood stabilization. Maintaining blood lithium concentration levels within a narrow therapeutic window between 0.6 and 1.5mM is vital for the patient as slightly elevated concentrations of the order of 0.1mMcan be toxic. This paper aims to evaluate the merits of tetrapolar electrical impedance spectroscopy as an alternative method in monitoring blood lithium levels. Measurements were performed using a custom-made tetrapolar probe in human blood plasma with lithium concentrations covering the therapeutic range. The results indicate a limit of detection less than 0.1 mM and a response time of less than 5 s. Prediction of lithium concentration levels using impedance values is in good agreement with conventional standard techniques to approximately 0.05 mM. This technique provides a basis for further development of instrumentation for point of care healthcare technologies.
5	26	98	Medical 	 HIV/AIDS  	 HIV        	Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that persons between 15 and 64 years get tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at least once in their lifetime and persons with HIV risk factors get tested more frequently. There is limited research examining factors associated with never testing for HIV among non-Hispanic Black men in the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of never testing for HIV, reasons for never testing for HIV, and correlates of never testing for HIV. We analyzed 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth data and restricted analyses to male respondents aged 15-44 years who self-identified as being non-Hispanic Black. Logistic regression models estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) assessing the association between socio-demographic and behavioral factors and never testing for HIV. An estimated 31.2 % of non-Hispanic Black males aged 15-44 years have never been tested for HIV. Non-Hispanic Black men aged 15-17 years (APR 4.45; 95 % CI 2.88-6.87) or 18-24 years (APR 1.94; 95 % CI 1.21-3.13), who did not visit a doctor or healthcare provider (APR 1.43; 95 % CI 1.10-1.86), or did not report any sexual risk behaviors in the past 12 months (APR 1.83; 95 % CI 1.34-2.51) were more likely to never test for HIV compared to their respective counterparts. Continued expansion of HIV testing initiatives and prevention programs that focus on non-Hispanic Black men is critical to addressing HIV-related health disparities and the public health burden of HIV in this population.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 12S; biogeography; COI; molecular phylogeny; population genetics        	This study examined the phylogeography of the barnacle Fistulobalanus albicostatus, which inhabits mangroves and estuarine shores in the West Pacific. Differentiation in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 12S ribosomal RNA (12S) genes of 401 specimens of F.albicostatus was examined in samples from 16 locations in the West Pacific, ranging from Honshu to Southern China. Our results revealed that F.albicostatus comprises two major clades exhibiting a COI divergence ranging from 1.25% to 2.8%. Clade A demonstrated the widest distribution, ranging from Japan to China, and was divided into three subclades occurring in the South China Sea (A1), Okinawa (A2), and Honshu, Korea and Qingdao (A3). Clade B was determined to be endemic to Okinawa; i.e. two endemic lineages occur in this island. Thus, F.albicostatus resembles several inter-tidal species in having clades that are endemic to Okinawan waters. Nevertheless, in contrast to the rocky inter-tidal barnacles Tetraclita spp. and Chthamalus malayensis, F.albicostatus was not found to be separated into continental and oceanic populations, but instead is divided into northern and southern clades, probably because of the Yangtze River discharge, which limits gene flow between the northern and southern populations.
5	29	101	Medical 	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome  	 gastroesophageal reflux disease; proton pump inhibitors; refractoriness; pH impedance; high-resolution manometry        	Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition that has a substantial impact on quality of life in patients and is a leading risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Now therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is a basic method in the treatment of patients with GERD; however, one third of the patients do not respond to the therapy used. The causes of refractory GERD are a fairly large group of heterogeneous factors contributing to the inefficacy of PPIs in adequate dosage. Among these factors, there is low compliance by patients to the prescribed treatment regimen; nocturnal acid breakthrough; CYP2C19 gene polymorphism; chiasm syndrome with functional diseases of the gastrointestinal tract; non-acidic refluxes in a patient; thoracic esophageal motility disorders; the increased number and duration of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation periods; hiatus hernia; and misdiagnosis. 24-hour pH impedance and high-resolution esophageal manometry are now the most informative diagnostic techniques in patients who fail to respond to PPI therapy. These techniques allow one to timely recognize the causes of refractory GERD, to make a differential diagnosis with other nosological entities, and to timely correct therapy for each individual patient.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 colitis; formula; immunity; intestine; microbiota; milk; newborn        	At birth, the newborn mammal undergoes a transition from a sterile uterine environment with a constant nutrient supply, to a microbe-rich environment with intermittent oral intake of complex milk nutrients via the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These functional challenges partly explain the relatively high morbidity and mortality of neonates. Preterm birth interrupts prenatal organ maturation, including that of the GIT, and increases disease risk. Exemplary is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is associated closely with GIT immaturity, enteral feeding, and bacterial colonization. Infants with NEC may require resection of the necrotic parts of the intestine, leading to short bowel syndrome (SBS), characterized by reduced digestive capacity, fluid loss, and dependency on parenteral nutrition. This review presents the preterm pig as a translational model in pediatric gastroenterology that has provided new insights into important pediatric diseases such as NEC and SBS. We describe protocols for delivery, care, and handling of preterm pigs, and show how the immature GIT responds to delivery method and different nutritional and therapeutic interventions. The preterm pig may also provide a sensitive model for postnatal adaptation of weak term piglets showing high mortality. Attributes of the preterm pig model include close similarities with preterm infants in body size, organ development, and many clinical features, thereby providing a translational advantage relative to rodent models of GIT immaturity. On the other hand, the need for a sow surgical facility, a piglet intensive care unit, and clinically trained personnel may limit widespread use of preterm pigs. Studies on organ adaptation in preterm pigs help to identify the physiological basis of neonatal survival for hypersensitive newborns and aid in defining the optimal diet and rearing conditions during the critical neonatal period.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 Human activity recognition; Depth sensors; Time series matching        	Human activity recognition has been widely studied since the last decade in ambient intelligence scenarios. Remarkable progresses have been made in this domain, especially in research lines such as ambient assisted living, gesture recognition, behaviour detection and classification, etc. Most of the works in the literature focus on activity classification or recognition, prediction of future events, or anomaly detection and prevention. However, it is hard to find approaches that do not only recognize an activity, but also provide an evaluation of its performance according to an optimality criterion. This problem is of special interest in applications such as sports performance evaluation, physical therapy, etc. In this work, we address the problem of the evaluation of such human activities in monitored environments using depth sensors. In particular, we propose a system able to provide an automatic evaluation of the correctness in the performance of activities involving motion, and more specifically, diagnosis exercises in physical therapy.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 gesture word recognition; threshold; gesture segmentation; centroid location; extreme algorithm        	Through the analysis and process of visual images of gesture words, this paper realizes the recognition of the gesture words, and this will lay a good foundation to recognize gesture language. Firstly, the acquired images are preprocessed by denoising; secondly the gesture images are segmented from the background images by setting their thresholds, and the outline of the gesture images information is obtained under morphology operations; thirdly by extracting centroid coordinates of the target gestures, the gesture images are positioned and segmented; in the end, the gesture words can be identified by calculating the extreme values to the modules. The above algorithm is validated through the Matlab software. The experimental results show that the algorithm is reliable and has good robustness.
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 Nanoceria; Nanofibers; Electrospinning; Antibacterial; Biomedical        	This study presents the fabrication and characterization of novel bactericidal Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers. Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers fabricated by physically blending Polyurethane (PU) with two biopolymers such as Cellulose acetate (CA) and Zein. The Nanoceria were prepared by electrospinning of a sol gel composed of cerium nitrate hexahydrate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone and followed by calcination and sonication. The physicochemical characterizations of the synthesized Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers were carried out by X-ray diffraction pattern, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The antibacterial activity was tested against most common pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia colt, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica (Gram-negative), Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (Gram-positive). The Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers have demonstrated effective toxicity against both the Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains. The obtained results indicate that the inhibition is dependent on the concentration of Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers. TEM analysis reveals that Nanoceria caused disruption of cell membranes which led to the irreversible damage to the cell envelope eventually leading to cell death. Generally, these Nanoceria doped composite nanofibers were depicted as a promising nanomaterial for exceptional antibacterial treatment and can be used as another smart material for biomedical and industrial applications.

1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 CMOS analogue circuits; automated design; Learnable Evolution Model; multi-objective; operational amplifier        	A new simulation based automated CMOS analog circuit design method which applies a multi-objective non-Darwinian-type evolutionary algorithm based on Learnable Evolution Model (LEM) is proposed in this article. The multi-objective property of this automated design of CMOS analog circuits is governed by a modified Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA) incorporated in the LEM algorithm presented here. LEM includes a machine learning method such as the decision trees that makes a distinction between high- and low-fitness areas in the design space. The learning process can detect the right directions of the evolution and lead to high steps in the evolution of the individuals. The learning phase shortens the evolution process and makes remarkable reduction in the number of individual evaluations. The expert designer's knowledge on circuit is applied in the design process in order to reduce the design space as well as the design time. The circuit evaluation is made by HSPICE simulator. In order to improve the design accuracy, bsim3v3 CMOS transistor model is adopted in this proposed design method. This proposed design method is tested on three different operational amplifier circuits. The performance of this proposed design method is verified by comparing it with the evolutionary strategy algorithm and other similar methods.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Men; Contraception; Intrauterine devices; Knowledge        	Objective: Increasing use of long-acting methods of contraception, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), has been recognized as a promising strategy to reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy. While men may play an important role in promoting or discouraging contraceptive use, very little research has examined men's knowledge of and attitudes toward IUDs. Study design: We used data from the 903 men included in the 2009 National Survey of Reproductive and Contraceptive Knowledge to examine their awareness and knowledge of IUDs and other contraceptive methods by several individual-level characteristics. Results: Men's awareness and perceived knowledge of IUDs is low in comparison to condoms and birth control pills. Men's perceived knowledge of IUDs was lower than their objective knowledge, as measured by true/false questions about IUDs, suggesting that men may be more knowledgeable of IUDs than they perceive. In the multivariate models, men who were uninsured [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.4; 95% confidence interval (Cl), 0.2-0.6], identified as Christian (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-1.0) and who had never had a sexual health visit (AOR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.0) were less likely to have heard of IUDs. Among men who had heard of the method, Hispanic men were less likely (AOR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5) to be more knowledgeable of the method. Conclusion: Young men report low awareness of IUDs in comparison to other methods, and this varies by demographic characteristics including health insurance status. Family planning programs should consider targeted knowledge promotion for young men, with a focus on contraceptive methods besides condoms and oral contraception. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 Stress; Karasek; Hospital; Occupation; Strain; Social support; Psychology        	"The nurse stress literature reports an overwhelming culture of acceptance and expectation of work stressors, ironically linked to the control of the workplace to effectively and proactively manage stress. The stressors involved in delivering ""stress management"" have been well studied in nursing-related workplaces, especially in acute care settings in accordance with the Karasek Job Demand-Control-Support (JDCS) model. However, little is known about the effects of specificity of an acute care unit and the level of qualifications on stress experienced by nurses. A survey using the JDCS model was conducted among 385 nurses working in three different acute care units (anesthesiology, emergency and intensive care unit) from a university hospital. Specific questions explored variables such as gender, acute care units, level of qualification and working experience. Two hundred questionnaires were returned. A high level of job strain was highlighted without a gender effect and in the absence of isostrain. Nurses from acute care units were located in the high stress quadrant of the JDCS model. Conversely, other nurses were commonly located in the ""active"" quadrant. Independent of acute care settings, the highest level of education was associated with the highest job strain and the lowest level of control. In an acute care setting, a high level of education was a key factor for high job stress and was associated with a perception of a low control in the workplace, both of which may be predictors of adverse mental health. In particular, the lack of control has been associated with moral distress, a frequently reported characteristic of acute care settings. To enhance the personal and professional outcomes of the advanced registered nurses, strategies for supporting nurses manage daily stressors in acute care are urgently required."
2	0	33	Psychology  	 Prejudice  	 bisexuality; education; Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA); pansexuality; professional development; queer theory; sexual and gender minorities ( SGM); social media; trans        	This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity wasmore nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 contraceptives; adolescent; young adult; Probit model; sample selection; Heckman; Costa Rica        	Objective: to analyze the factors that affect use and nonuse of contraception in adolescent and young adults in Costa Rica (between ages 15 - 35). Methods: The influence of personal and socioeconomic characteristics in the decision of the use of contraception can be observed through data collected in the survey National Youth Survey 2007 (Encuesta Nacional de Juventud 2007) and the methodology based on the binary Probit Model with selection bias correction through Heckman. Results: it is showed that the age of both the person and the partner, the stability of the relationship, and residency in urban areas are factors related to lower probability of contraception use. On the other hand, being female, having university education, access to information about birth control and STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases), frequency in sexual intercourse, and good supportive family relationships are factors related to higher probability of contraception use. Conclusions: This results could work as a guide to design public policies to prevent teenage pregnancies and STDs. Furthermore, it is important to highlight the significance of sex education for teenagers and their families. This way, education could go beyond encouraging abstinence; it could motivate a responsible sexual life.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Music therapy; Behavioral; Cognitive; Dementia; Meta-analysis        	Demographic aging is a worldwide phenomenon, cognitive and behavioral impairment is becoming global burden of nerve damage. However, the effect of pharmacological treatment is not satisfying. Therefore, we analyzed the efficacy of music therapy in elderly dementia patients, and if so, whether music therapy can be used as first-line non-pharmacological treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EMbase and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2016. A total of 34 studies (42 analyses, 1757 subjects) were included; all of them had an acceptable quality based on the PEDro and CASP scale scores. Studies based on any type of dementia patient were combined and analyzed by subgroup. The standardized mean difference was -0.42 (-0.74 to -0.11) for disruptive behavior and 0.20 (-0.09 to 0.49) for cognitive function as primary outcomes in random effect models using controls as the comparator; the secondary outcomes were depressive score, anxiety and quality of life. No evidence of publication bias was found based on Begg's and Egger's test. The meta-analysis confirmed that the baseline differences between the two groups were balanced. Subgroup analyses showed that disease sub-type, intervention method, comparator, subject location, trial design, trial period and outcome measure instrument made little difference in outcomes. The meta-regression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as the intervention method, comparator and trial design. Music therapy was effective when patients received interactive therapy with a compared group. There was positive evidence to support the use of music therapy to treat disruptive behavior and anxiety; there were positive trends supporting the use of music therapy for the treatment of cognitive function, depression and quality of life.

1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 Analog signal processing; Floating inductor simulator; Dual-output current-controlled current conveyor; Operational transconductance amplifier        	In this letter, a new floating inductance simulator circuit is presented. The proposed structure consists of only one grounded capacitor without any external resistors and two different active elements. The active elements are dual-output current-controlled current conveyor (DO-CCCII) and operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). The proposed inductance simulator can be tuned electronically by changing the biasing current of the DO-CCCIIs or by changing the current of the OTA. Moreover, the circuit does not require any conditions of component matching. It has a good sensitivity performance with respect to tracking errors. As an application, the proposed inductance simulator is used to construct a fourth-order resistively terminated LC band-pass filter. The theoretical analysis is verified by the SPICE simulation results. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 chronic kidney disease; kidney transplant; rejection; T cell        	Purpose of review Altered differentiation and activation of T-cell subsets occur in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the impact on graft rejection and protective immunity during transplantation are not fully understood. Recent findings Patients with CKD have decreased frequency of naive T cells, accumulation of activated, terminally differentiated memory cells, and skewed regulatory versus T helper 17 ratio. Naive and memory T-cell subsets do not appear to improve following kidney transplantation. Retained thymic output is associated with acute rejection, whereas naive lymphopenia and accumulation of CD8(+) TEMRA cells correlate with long-term graft dysfunction. CD28(null) memory cells accumulate during CKD and appear to confer protection against acute rejection under standard immunosuppression and possibly costimulation blockade. T cells bearing CD57 are also increased in patients with CKD and may underlie rejection during costimulation blockade. Summary The mechanisms by which CKD alters the differentiation and activation status of T-cell subsets is poorly understood. Further research is also needed to understand which cell populations mediate rejection under various immunosuppressive regimens. To date, there is little use of animal models of organ failure in transplant immunology research. CKD mouse models may help identify novel pathways and targets to better control alloimmunity in posttransplant.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Surface roughness; Color distribution statistical matrix; Overlap degree of color; Robustness to the light source; Texture direction        	A ground surface roughness measurement method is proposed to address current problems in the use of machine vision technology to measure roughness: the calculations are complex, and the measurement process is largely affected by the light source. Based on the area of diffusion regions between the virtual images formed by a light source on ground surfaces with different roughness levels are different, a reference light source containing two base color is designed. Red and green color space-based color distribution statistical matrices, as well as corresponding overlap indices, are proposed. A relationship model between overlap index and roughness is constructed. The effect of light source brightness and texture direction on the relationship model is discussed based on the experimental data. The results demonstrate that the surface roughness measurement method, which is based on the overlap degree of the color image, has relatively high accuracy and a relatively wide measurement range and is, to a certain degree, robust to the brightness of the light source and the texture direction. The surface roughness measurement method has huge potential for engineering applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 joint action; development; early childhood; action planning        	The planning and adjusting of one's actions in relation to an action partner is fundamental to smooth joint action. During their first years of life, children gradually become more engaged in joint actions. Here, we investigated whether and at what age children take their partner into account in their action plans to accommodate the other's actions. We focused on children's proactive planning (without prior experience) and flexible adjustment of action plans over time. In a behavioural study, we tested 96 children from four age groups (4, 3, 32 and 5 years) in a joint cup-stacking task. Children passed cups to their partner who had only one hand available (alternating over time) to build a tower. Children's response choices were assessed (i.e. passing the cup on the free or occupied side to their partner). The study yielded two major findings. At all ages, children proactively planned their actions in a way that accommodated their partner's actions. However, only by 31, years did children start to flexibly integrate their partner into their action plans. Even at age 5, children only showed minimal adjustments to their action partner. Candidate processes underlying these developmental changes (e.g. inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, perspective taking) are discussed.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 rural water supply; sanitary surveys; water quality; springs; dug wells; rainwater harvesting        	Information about the quality of rural drinking water sources can be used to manage their safety and mitigate risks to health. Sanitary surveys, which are observational checklists to assess hazards present at water sources, are simpler to conduct than microbial tests. We assessed whether sanitary survey results were associated with measured indicator bacteria levels in rural drinking water sources in Kisii Central, Kenya. Overall, thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels were high: all of the samples from the 20 tested dug wells, almost all (95%) of the samples from the 25 tested springs, and 61% of the samples from the 16 tested rainwater harvesting systems were contaminated with TTC. There were no significant associations between TTC levels and overall sanitary survey scores or their individual components. Contamination by TTC was associated with source type (dug wells and springs were more contaminated than rainwater systems). While sanitary surveys cannot be substituted for microbial water quality results in this context, they could be used to identify potential hazards and contribute to a comprehensive risk management approach.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Anaerobic digestion; Codigestion; Dairy; Waste management; Nutrient management; Economic feasibility        	There has been sustained interest from both environmental regulators and livestock associations to expand the use of anaerobic digester (AD) technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, the generally profitable practice of codigesting off-farm organic waste could increase nitrogen and phosphorus content to the farm and exacerbate nutrient over-application concerns near large animal operations. We examine the economic feasibility of a broad set of dairy waste management systems composed of two technology groups that mitigate air and water pollution: an AD system that includes either animal waste input or combination animal/off-farm organic waste codigestion input and either compressed natural gas (CNG) or combined heat and power (CHP) output; and a filtration system that includes fiber separation, nutrient separation, and/or water recovery. We conclude that AD setups without codigestion are only economically feasible under limited conditions, but scenarios which use codigestion have the potential to contribute to nutrient over-application without nutrient separation technology. Trends for CNG and CHP match closely. Net present value (NPV) is greatest for AD with CNG scenarios. Estimated NPV for AD with CNG and environmental credits is $1.8 million and $39.7 million for dairies with 1600 and 15,000 wet cow equivalents, respectively. For these firm sizes, the addition of codigestion contributes $4.8 million and $47.3 million, respectively, to estimated NPV. Nutrient separation and water recovery both lead to decreases in scenario NPV with codigestion, but with the right policies, dairy owners may be willing to adopt AD with nutrient separation.

0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 Algorithm; Section 2(b); Expression; Google        	As a result of rapid advances in technology and computer programming, algorithms are increasingly able to generate expressive material. In light of these advances, it is inevitable that courts will be asked to determine whether this algorithmically generated content is protected expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Although algorithmically generated content can serve many of the same constitutionally-protected purposes as human expression, this paper explains why the Supreme Court of Canada's current framework is inadequate for use in the context of algorithmically generated content. This paper offers a proactive and principled solution that is consistent with the fundamental principles of freedom of expression articulated by the Court in R v Keegstra. This solution allows content that upholds the Keegstra principles to be protected despite the fact that the algorithm's creator may not have contemplated the specific content.
1	12	29	ECE 	 Signal-flow graph  	 analog test generation; mixed-signal test generation; backtracing; parametric faults; catastrophic faults        	We describe a new reverse simulation approach to analog and mixed-signal circuit test generation that parallels digital test generation. We invert the analog circuit signal flow graph, reverse simulate it with good and bad machine outputs, and obtain test waveforms and component tolerances, given circuit output tolerances specified by the functional test needs of the designer. The inverted graph allows backtracing to justify analog outputs with analog input sinusoids. Mixed-signal circuits can be tested using this approach, and we present test generation results for two mixed-signal circuits and four analog circuits, one being a multiple-input, multiple-output circuit. This analog backtrace method can generate tests for second-order analog circuits and certain non-linear circuits. These cannot be handled by existing methods, which lack a fault model and a backtrace method. Our proposed method also defines the necessary tolerances on circuit structural components, in order to keep the output circuit signal within the envelope specified by the designer. This avoids the problem of overspecifying analog circuit component tolerances, and reduces cost. We prove that our parametric fault tests also detect all catastrophic faults. Unlike prior methods, ours is a structural, rather than functional, analog test generation method.

Usually the method does not give any solution if the balance number is more than one, but we apply MSE method successfully in different way to carry out the solutions of nonlinear evolution equation with balance number two. Finally some graphical results of the velocity profiles are presented for different values of the material constants. It is shown that this method, without help of any symbolic computation, provide a straightforward and powerful mathematical tool for solving nonlinear evolution equation.

To identify those genes, a proteomics-based analysis of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in comparison to vehicle treated control cells was performed. MG132 treatment induced reproducible changes in the protein expression profile, which was analyzed by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by tryptic peptide mass fingerprinting for spot identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The identified protein alterations could be grouped into three major categories: (1) induction of small heat shock proteins (HSPs) with chaperonic function, such as HSP27, alpha beta-crystallin, and cardiovascular HSP, (2) altered expression of actin associated proteins, such as cofilin-1 and transgelin, and (3) induction of antioxidant proteins, such as peroxiredoxin-1, superoxide dismutase-1, and hemeoxygenase-1. Northern blotting revealed that expression was regulated at the mRNA level. Given that proteasomal activity is decreased in cardiovascular diseases, alterations in proteasome-dependent control of mRNA expression could provide a novel mechanism by which disease progression is modulated.

Weighing the objective merits and problem areas of DE, we will try to justify the existing requirements, opportunities and tools of DE and propose ways to improve it in order to higher education institutions of Kazakhstan, including Almaty Management University, could compete in the educational market in the world educational space. The aim of the study is to improve the instruments in the creation of educational products for distance education. It includes evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of distance learning format at the university, the model of existing distance education: naugramma, determination of weak points in DE implementation, one-way contact problems: causes of a ""blank shot"", transfer of knowledge through the computer monitors, face-to-face contact: verbal and nonverbal communication of a teacher with a student. The conditions for development of DE were recent achievements in technologies of teaching, media and communications, the rapid development and widespread use of a variety of technical means. Primarily, they refer to the computer and information technology, satellite communication systems, educational television, mass connection to information systems and distribution of learning software and videos. To implement the model ''Only Distance Education at the three stages"" we have analyzed the methods used in DE in secondary education. As an example, we analyzed teaching chemistry at a secondary school for disabled children in Moscow. The research of the first stage (secondary school) and analysis of applying distance form of education at the second stage (university) together with assessment of problematic areas have resulted in creating an effective model. When implemented, this model will work with great efficiency and help to eliminate many difficulties that slow down the realization of the whole package of instruments of Distance Education."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the experience of parents who have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and their perceptions regarding access to appropriate parenting supports and resources. MethodsEleven mothers and one father with a past and/or present diagnosis of borderline personality disorder participated in focus groups in which they were asked questions about their experiences of parenting and service provision. Participants were aged between 29 and 59 years (M = 40.17; standard deviation = 9.53), and the majority identified themselves as Caucasian (83%). The study design was qualitative, and thematic analysis was utilised to identify common themes. ResultsThematic analysis identified four key themes of parenting challenges, parenting rewards, barriers to accessing support, and recommendations for improving parenting experience. Seventeen subthemes were also identified and are represented graphically. ConclusionsParents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder find parenting both a challenging and rewarding experience. While a number of themes identified by parents with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder are similar to those reported by parents with other forms of severe mental illness (i.e., rewards, stigma, fear of custody loss, and negative service provision experiences), there was also evidence of specific themes relating to the symptoms of borderline personality disorder and parenting. Recommendations are provided for improving services for these parents.
5	9	81	Medical 	 Skin Care  	 bioadhesive polymers; delivery/vectorization/penetration; rheology; skin barrier        	INTRODUCTION: The use of bioadhesive hydrogels for skin care presents important advantages such as long residence times on the application site and reduced product administration frequency. OBJECT: The aim of the present work was to develop bioadhesive hydrogels for skin application, using caffeine as a model active ingredient. METHODS: Eight hydrogels were formulated using binary combinations of a primary polymer (carbomer homopolymer type C (Carbopol((R)) 980) or kappa carrageenan potassium salt (Gelcarin((R)) GP-812 NF)) and a secondary polymer (carbomer copolymer type B (Pemulen TR-1), xanthan gum or guar gum). Hydrogels were characterized by means ofphysico-chemical (dynamic rheological measurements, spreadability and adhesion measurements) and sensory methods (projective mapping in combination with a check-all-that-apply (CATA) question). Caffeine hydrogels were formulated using two of the most promising formulations regarding adhesion properties and sensory characteristics. In vitro active ingredient release studies were carried out. RESULTS: Hydrogel formulations showed a prevalently elastic rheological behaviour. Complex viscosity of carbomer homopolymer type C hydrogels was higher than that of the kappa carrageenan hydrogels. Besides, complex viscosity values were dependent on the secondary polymer present in the formulation. Significant differences among hydrogels were found in detachment force, work of adhesion and spreading diameter results. Association of projective mapping with CATA allowed to determine similarities and dissimilarities among samples. Cluster analysis associated the samples in two groups. Two hydrogels were selected to study the release of caffeine. Both hydrogels presented similar release profiles which were well described by the Higuchi model. Caffeine release was exclusively controlled by a diffusive process. CONCLUSION: Physico-chemical and sensory techniques enabled the identification of bioadhesive hydrogel formulations with positive characteristics for cosmetic applications. Formulations which combined carbomer homopolymer type C with xanthan gum or with carbomer copolymer type B were the most promising for bioadhesive skin products. Caffeine release profiles of selected formulations were not statistically different. Both hydrogels gradually released the active ingredient, reaching approximately 80% within the first 5h, and their profiles were well described by the Higuchi model. In this context, it could be concluded that the selected hydrogels are suitable bioadhesive hydrogel formulations for cosmetic application on the skin.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 LSD1; EZH2; Histone modification; Interferon pathway; IRF9        	Histone methylation is a complicate and dynamic epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription, chromosomal structure and cell differentiation. Here, we discovered the interaction between the H3K4 demethylase, lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, an important component of CoREST repressor complex) and the H3K27 methyltransferase, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2, an essential component of PRC2). Immuno-precipitation and GST-pull down assay were performed to observe the interaction between the proteins. The MCF-7 cells were cultured and transfected with the siRNA. The mRNA and proteins were examined by using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot assay, respectively. HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis were performed to purify the proteins. RTPCR- based quantitative ChIP analysis were performed. LSD1 interacts with histone modification protein EZH2 in MCF-7 cells. LSD1 and EZH2 target a few common genes. LSD1 knockdown and EZH2 knockdown affect protein expression. LSD1 knockdown and EZH2 knockdown affect the proteins involving in IFN signaling pathway. LSD1 and EZH2 modify histone methylation at IRF9 gene locus. We systematically analyzed the proteins that are affected by either LSD1 or EZH2 knockdown with proteomic approaches and identified that the interferon pathway and some other pathways are commonly affected. The interaction between LSD1 and EZH2 stabilizes the binding of LSD1 to the promoter region of IRF9, which is a key transcription factor of the interferon pathway. In conclusion, our study revealed that the coordination between histone demethylases and methyl-transferases might serve as a double lock system to suppress the expression of interferon stimulated genes.

5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 Mesterolone; Andropause; Prostate        	Objective: To investigate the effects of mesterolone on prostate in patients treated for aging male syndrome. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted from June to September, 2009, at endocrinology and metabolism department of Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey, and comprised patients with symptoms of aging male syndrome and/or low testosterone. They were given mesterolone 50mg/day per oral for two months. Aging Male Symptoms and International Prostate Symptom Score questionaires and prostate-related quality of life scores were completed and prostate ultrasonography (USG) was performed before and after the treatment. Total testosterone, free testosterone, gonadotropins, estradiol, prolactin, sex-hormone binding globulin, as well as total and free prostate-specific antigen were also studied. Results: Of the 34 patients in the study, 22(64.70%) had their prostate volume increased, while 12(35.29%) had it decreased. The change, however, was not statistically significant (p<0.098). Mesterolone significantly improved Aging Male Symptoms, International Prostate Symptom and prostate-related quality of life scores (p<0.001). These improvements though significant were independent of the changes in prostate volume. Total testosterone, sex-hormone binding globulin andestradiol decreased, while free testosterone showed no change (p<0.002, p<0.001, p<0.024, p<0.337). The fraction of free testosterone increased (p<0.001), while total and free prostate-specific antigen did not change (p<0.368 and p<0.841) Conclusion: Mesterolone proved to be a safe alternative in the treatment of Aging Male Syndrome. It also improved lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate-related quality of life.

This system is used to perform a power-frequency HV on-site voltage withstanding test. First, the basic principle of the MCRT is introduced. Next, a Fourier analysis based on the equivalent magnetic and electrical circuits of the MCRT is described. This analysis provides a design reference for the basic MCRT parameters. In addition, a finite-element model was constructed to verify the MCRT design. Finally, an MCRT prototype was designed to verify the effectiveness of the test system. Compared with the traditional HV test systems, the proposed test system in this paper has the advantages of compact structure, stable secondary voltage, and wide reactance adjustment range.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 Urban harvest approach; Water management; Urban water; Water cycle; Household water demand; Residential water consumption        	Earlier results indicated that, for an average household, self-sufficiency in water supply can be achieved by following the Urban harvest Approach (UHA), in a combination of demand minimization, cascading and multi-sourcing. To achieve these results, it was assumed that all available local resources can be harvested. In reality, however, temporal, spatial and location-bound factors pose limitations to this harvest and, thus, to self-sufficiency. This article investigates potential spatial and temporal limitations to harvest local water resources at building level for the Netherlands, with a focus on indoor demand. Two building types were studied, a free standing house (one four-people household) and a mid-rise apartment flat (28 two-person households). To be able to model yearly water balances, daily patterns considering household occupancy and presence of water using appliances were defined per building type. Three strategies were defined. The strategies include demand minimization, light grey water (LGW) recycling, and rainwater harvesting (multi-sourcing). Recycling and multi-sourcing cater for toilet flushing and laundry machine. Results showed that water saving devices may reduce 30% of the conventional demand. Recycling of LGW can supply 100% of second quality water (D-Q2) which represents 36% of the conventional demand or up to 20% of the minimized demand. Rainwater harvesting may supply approximately 80% of the minimized demand in case of the apartment flat and 60% in case of the free standing house. To harvest these potentials, different system specifications, related to the household type, are required. Two constraints to recycle and multi-source were identified, namely i) limitations in the grey water production and available rainfall; and ii) the potential to harvest water as determined by the temporal pattern in water availability, water use, and storage and treatment capacities.

5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 Sexual health; Media analysis; Gender; Sexual risk; Prevention        	"Background: The need to challenge messages that reinforce harmful negative discourses around sexual risk and responsibility is a priority in improving sexual health. The mass media are an important source of information regularly alerting, updating and influencing public opinions and the way in which sexual health issues are framed may play a crucial role in shaping expectations of who is responsible for sexual health risks and healthy sexual practices. Methods: We conducted an in-depth, qualitative analysis of 85 negatively toned newspaper articles reporting on sexual health topics to examine how risk and responsibility have been framed within these in relation to gender. Articles published in 2010 in seven UK and three Scottish national newspapers were included. A latent content analysis approach was taken, focusing on interpreting the underlying meaning of text. Results: A key theme in the articles was men being framed as a risk to women's sexual health, whilst it was part of a women's role to ""resist"" men's advances. Such discourses tended to portray a power imbalance in sexual relationships between women and men. A number of articles argued that it was women who needed to take more responsibility for sexual health. Articles repeatedly suggested that women and teenage girls in particular, lacked the skills and confidence to negotiate safer sex and sex education programmes were often presented as having failed. Men were frequently portrayed as being more promiscuous and engaging in more risky sexual health behaviours than women, yet just one article drew attention to the lack of focus on male responsibility for sexual health. Gay men were used as a bench mark against which rates were measured and framed as being a risk and at risk. Conclusions: The framing of men as a risk to women, whilst women are presented at the same time as responsible for patrolling sexual encounters, organising contraception and preventing sexual ill health reinforces gender stereotypes and undermines efforts to promote a collective responsibility for sexual health. This has implications for sexual ill health prevention and could continue to reinforce a negative culture around sex, relationships and sexual health in the UK."
5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 Emergency contraception; Emergency departments; HIV/STI testing and prophylaxis; Mental health counseling; Sexual assault; Sexual assault forensic/nurse examiner programs        	Objective: To describe medical services provided to sexual assault patients in US emergency departments and to identify the percentage of hospitals always providing the 10 elements of comprehensive medical care management (CMCM). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a national sample of US hospitals. A 26-item telephone survey assessed provision of services to sexual assault survivors in accordance with CMCM. Management included acute medical care comprising history and physical examination; acute and long-term rape crisis counseling; STI testing and prophylaxis; emergency contraception counseling and provision; and HIV testing and prophylaxis. The primary outcome was extent of provision of these elements. Results: Overall, 582 emergency departments responded to the survey. The following components of CMCM were provided: acute medical care (582 [100.0%]); rape crisis counseling (234 [40.2%]); STI management (448 [77.0%]); emergency contraception (351 [60.3%]); and HIV management (380 [65.3%]). Only 101 (17.4%) hospitals provided all 10 elements of CMCM. Conclusion: Less than one-fifth of US hospitals provide comprehensive services to sexual assault patients. A national program incorporating clinical guidelines, checklists, and funding for sexual assault forensic/nurse examiner programs could improve the standard of care provided in emergency departments the primary point of contact for acute care of sexual assault survivors.

2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 children's memory; children's suggestibility; experience; expertise; feedback        	The aim of this article was to explore whether psychologists, lawyers, and psychology students would be able to predict how children behave in memory and suggestibility experiments and if this ability is associated with different measures of experience. The participants (N = 63) were to predict the results of a series of published research studies pertaining to children's memory and suggestibility. The results indicated that the ability of the participants to predict the behavior of children was overall low and unrelated to experience. It was concluded that professionals who should be able to assess children's functioning as witnesses may not be able to do so.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Parental warmth; Harsh discipline; Externalizing problems; Developmental trajectory; Person-oriented approach        	Although parenting is one of the most commonly studied predictors of child problem behavior, few studies have examined parenting as a multidimensional and dynamic construct. This study investigated different patterns of developmental trajectories of two parenting dimensions (harsh discipline [HD] and parental warmth [PW]) with a person-oriented approach and examined the associations between different parenting patterns and child externalizing problems and callous-unemotional traits. Data were drawn from the combined high-risk control and normative sample (n = 753) of the Fast Track Project. Parent-reported HD and observer-reported PW from kindergarten to grade 2 were fit to growth mixture models. Two subgroups were identified for HD (low decreasing, 83.0 %; high stable, 17.0 %) and PW (high increasing, 78.7 %; low increasing, 21.3 %). The majority of parents (67.0 %) demonstrated the low decreasing HD and high increasing PW pattern, while the prevalence of the high stable HD and low increasing PW pattern was the lowest (6.8 %). Parenting satisfaction, parental depression, family socioeconomic status, and neighborhood safety predicted group memberships jointly defined by the two dimensions. Children from the high stable HD and low increasing PW pattern showed the highest levels of externalizing problems in grades 4 and 5. Children from the low decreasing HD and low increasing PW pattern showed the highest levels of callous-unemotional traits in grade 7. These findings demonstrate the utility and significance of a person-oriented approach to measuring parenting as a multidimensional and dynamic construct and reveal the interplay between HD and PW in terms of their influences on child developmental outcomes.

Meanwhile, design effects were verified by simulation and experimental test.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 Flash memory; internet of things (IoT); microcontroller unit (MCU); resistive random-access memory (ReRAM); sensor hub        	This paper proposes embedding 256 Kb resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) in a microcontroller unit as a data buffer for communicating with a stand-alone flash memory. In this study, the chip was manufactured using a combination of the TSMC 0.18 mu m process and the Industrial Technology Research Institute ReRAM back-end-of-line process. The ReRAM was equipped with a novel sense amplifier that had three magnification times for the reference cell current for increasing the read yield by 32%. Furthermore, the ReRAM controller included built-in self-test, built-in self-repair, a shortened Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (99, 64, 5) error-correlating code, and asymmetric coding can yield ReRAM up to approximately 100%. When compared with the conventional dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) buffer, the proposed architecture reduces the system execution time by 25% and the power consumption by 15% at 25 MHz. Simulations also showed that the ReRAM buffering runs at least 51% faster when compared with the use of other nonvolatile memories such as ferroelectric RAM, phase change RAM, and conduct-bridge RAM. Although ReRAM buffering is just competitive in speed and power consumption of spin-transfer torque magnetorresistive RAM buffering, ReRAM has clear advantages in area, cost, and reliability.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 cell differentiation; Nicotiana tabacum; gene expression; short peptides; plant growth regulation        	Exogenous short biologically active peptides epitalon (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly), bronchogen (Ala-Glu-Asp-Leu), and vilon (Lys-Glu) at concentrations 10(-7)-10(-9) M significantly influence growth, development, and differentiation of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) callus cultures. Epitalon and bronchogen, in particular, both increase growth of calluses and stimulate formation and growth of leaves in plant regenerants. Because the regulatory activity of the short peptides appears at low peptide concentrations, their action to some extent is like that of the activity of phytohormones, and it seems to have signaling character and epigenetic nature. The investigated peptides modulate in tobacco cells the expression of genes including genes responsible for tissue formation and cell differentiation. These peptides differently modulate expression of CLE family genes coding for known endogenous regulatory peptides, the KNOX1 genes (transcription factor genes) and GRF (growth regulatory factor) genes coding for respective DNA-binding proteins such as topoisomerases, nucleases, and others. Thus, at the level of transcription, plants have a system of short peptide regulation of formation of long-known peptide regulators of growth and development. The peptides studied here may be related to a new generation of plant growth regulators. They can be used in the experimental botany, plant molecular biology, biotechnology, and practical agronomy.
1	2	19	ECE 	 Electrical circuits  	 Microbial fuel cell; Community growth and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy        	Background: A laboratory-scale two-chamber microbial fuel cell employing an aerated cathode with no catalyst was inoculated with mixed inoculum and acetate as the carbon source. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the behavior of the MFC during initial biofilm (week 1) and maximum power density (week 20). EIS were performed on the anode chamber, biofilm (without anolyte) and anolyte (without biofilm). Nyquist plots of the EIS data were fitted with two equivalent electrical circuits to estimate the contributions of intrinsic resistances to the overall internal MFC impedance at weeks 1 and 20, respectively. Results: The results showed that the system tended to increase power density from 15 +/- 3 (week 1) to 100 +/- 15 mW/m(2) (week 20) and current density 211 +/- 7 (week 1) to 347 +/- 29 mA/m(2) (week 20). The Samples were identified by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and showed that initial inoculum (week 1) was constituted by Proteobacteria (40%), Bacteroidetes (22%) and Firmicutes (18%). At week 20, Proteobacterial species were predominant (60%) for electricity generation in the anode biofilm, being 51% Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Meanwhile on anolyte, Firmicutes phylum was predominant with Bacillus sp. This study proved that under the experimental conditions used there is an important contribution from the interaction of the biofilm and the anolyte on cell performance. Table 1 presents a summary of the specific influence of each element of the system under study. Conclusions: The results showed certain members of the bacterial electrode community increased in relative abundance from the initial inoculum. For example, Proteobacterial species are important for electricity generation in the anode biofilms and Firmicutes phylum was predominant on anolyte to transfer electron. R1 is the same in the three systems and no variation is observed over time. The biofilm makes a significant contribution to the charge transfer processes at the electrode (R2 and Cdl) and, consequently, on the performance of the anode chamber. The biofilm can act as a barrier which reduces diffusion of the anolyte towards the electrode, all the while behaving like a porous material. The anolyte and its interaction with the biofilm exert a considerable influence on diffusion processes, given that it presents the highest values for Rd which increased at week 20.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Chopper offset-stabilized operational amplifier; RC notch filter; ripple rejection; undershoot; overshoot; settling time        	The paper presents three approaches for frequency compensation in chopper offset-stabilized amplifiers with symmetrical passive RC notch filter with two cutoff frequencies. The filter has two cutoff frequencies: the chopping frequency itself and the fifth harmonic of the chopping frequency. The frequency compensation network is connected either at the input of the notch filter, or at its output, or between its two sections. The large signal transient response is evaluated in terms of the overshoot/undershoot and the settling time. Three circuits using these techniques were fabricated and evaluated. The approach that uses the frequency compensation network connected between the sections of the filter has the best results, except for the chopping ripple rejection.

Study 1 (N = 84 women) showed that life drawing had a positive impact on state body image, but only if artists observed a human model and not non-human objects. Study 2 (N = 61 women, 61 men) showed that life drawing had a positive impact on state body image for women and men, irrespective of whether artists observed a sex-congruent or -incongruent model. Study 3 (N = 23) showed that participating in weekly life drawing sessions for a 6-week period resulted in significantly elevated trait positive body image (body appreciation and body pride) and embodiment, and in reduced social physique anxiety; however, the intervention had no significant impact on negative body image (drive for thinness or muscularity). These results highlight the potential of life drawing for promoting positive body experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	47	119	Medical 	 Rheumatoid Arthritis  	 Rheumatoid arthritis; Arterial hypertension; Retinal nerve fiber layer; Optic coherence tomography; Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III        	To investigate the additive systemic inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in arterial hypertension patients, structural and morphological changes of the retina and optic nerve head were assessed by modern topographic technologies. Similarities of underlying vascular mechanisms between RA and arterial hypertension are interesting and have not been researched in depth. The aim of this study is to evaluate changes of RA and arterial hypertension with the optic coherence topography (OCT) and Heidelberg retina tomography (HRT III), to validate RA changes in comparison to arterial hypertension only patients and, finally, if these methods are useful to detect the chronic inflammatory influence of the RA on the eye. In this prospective study design, data of 18 patients with RA and arterial hypertension (55.3 +/- 4.31 years old), positive for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides, 21 patients with arterial hypertension (54.2 +/- 4.18 years old) and 19 healthy subjects (53.1 +/- 3.25 years old) were included. Intensive ophthalmologic and internistic screening tests were carried out in all subjects. All participants were investigated for the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macula thickness with the OCT (Carl Zeiss AG Germany) and for stereometric parameters of the optic nerve head with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III (Heidelberg Engineering Germany). The pachymetry was conducted by the Orbscan II system (Bausch & Lomb). Statistical data were assessed by SPSS, v20.0. No significant differences were found in visual function, diastolic and systolic blood pressure. RNFL, and macular thickness (Stratus-OCT) were almost consistent between the groups and even the main stereometric parameters measured with HRT III showed no significant differences. Contrary to our study hypothesis no structural and morphological changes could be detected in patients with arterial hypertension without RA compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, no RA-specific effects could be shown in comparison with the hypertension group. Thus, the used examination techniques are not suitable to prove the systemic inflammatory influence of RA on the eye.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Prevention; Chlamydia; Gonorrhea; Trichomonas; HIV        	Inadequate access to prevention and medical treatment for female sex workers (SW) represents a challenge for the German health system. Accessibility and care for SW in Bochum (Germany) through a cooperation between the Interdisciplinary Immunology Outpatient Clinic, Center for Sexual Health and Medicine of St. Josef's Hospital, the Bochum health department and the Madonna e.V. was the focus of this work. Medical outreach services were provided for the diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in SW in brothels in Bochum between August 2013 and January 2014. After clarification and verbal consent from the SW, free HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis tests were offered and carried out using pseudonyms for the SW. A total of 112 SW were reached (up to 55.4 % within the framework of the STI Outreach Study). Of the SW, 94.6 % had an immigrant background. The majority (61.3 %) of SW were between 20 und 29 years old. Only 19.0 % of the collective had health insurance. The following STIs were diagnosed: 12.5 % chlamydia, 6.2 % syphilis, 3.6 % gonorrhea, 3.6 % trichomoniasis, and 0.9 % HIV. These results were compared with results from STI studies in SW in Germany. Treatment was performed in accordance with the standards of the German STI Society. The offer improved the accessibility and the utilization of medical services by SW in Bochum. A further improvement of services is urgently needed.
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 AESA; radar trends; platform; based; MIMO; signal processing        	Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology will enable next generation radars achieve better jamming resistance capability and low probability of intercept by spreading their emissions over a wide frequency range. These radars systems consist of a large number of transmit/receive modules (TRMs) which are electronically scanned in a tight time-synchronized manner. This requires digital control to move closer to the radio front end on the antennas. Other emerging technologies, such as cognitive radars and MIMO radars, will continue to drive the need for complex timing, synchronization, and high mix RF and digital measurement requirements. To meet these challenges, radar engineers will need a platform based approach which delivers capabilities such as multi-channel phase aligned measurements over wide bandwidths and high-throughput streaming. This paper discusses the fundamentals of AESA radars and trends in radar systems. It analyzes the impact of these trends on test system architecture and explains how the advances in PXI modular instrumentation can meet these challenging requirements.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Ethnic diversity; African American; Parenting; Authoritarian; Self-regulation        	Research suggests that higher levels of authoritarian parenting exist in African American (AA) families than in European American (EA) families, and that authoritarian attitudes may be associated with more positive outcomes in AA families than EA families. However, less is known about authoritarian attitudes and children's development within AA families. This within-group study of 50 African American mothers and their 3-year-old children examined associations between maternal authoritarian attitudes, observed maternal limit-setting strategies, and children's self-regulation during a limit-setting interaction. The findings indicate that while AA families may hold more authoritarian attitudes than EA families, the direction of effect of authoritarian attitudes on children's outcomes appears to be the same in both ethnic groups. In this sample, when examining AA authoritarian attitudes relative to those of other AA mothers, less or lower authoritarian attitudes were associated with authoritative limit-setting behavior (firm limits within the context of overall warmth and responsiveness) and better children's self-regulation.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 X-ray testing; computer vision; baggage inspection; image analysis        	In order to reduce the security risk of commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in their carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually-controlled baggage screening process. In this paper, the use of an automated method based on multiple X-ray views is proposed to recognise certain regular objects with highly-defined shapes and sizes. The method consists of two steps: 'monocular analysis', to obtain possible detections in each view of a sequence, and 'multiple view analysis', to recognise the objects of interest using matching in all views. The search for matching candidates is efficiently performed using a look-up table that is computed offline. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on recognising regular objects (clips, springs and razor blades) in pencil cases are shown achieving high precision and recall (P-r = 95.7%, R-e = 92.5%) for 120 objects. We believe that it would be possible to design an automated aid in a target detection task using the proposed algorithm.

They have been introduced as transgenes into different species to enhance host resistance to pathogens. In this study, a fusion gene of two defensins, Trigonella foenum-graecum defensin 2 (Tfgd2) and Raphanus sativus antifungal protein 2 (RsAFP2) fused by a linker peptide of a polyprotein precursor from Impatiens balsamina was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum var. Xanthi) via Agrobacterium-mediated leaf section transformation. Putative transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR analysis and integration of the fusion gene was confirmed by Southern blotting. RT-PCR analysis showed that the fusion gene was expressed in several confirmed transgenic plants. Western blotting analysis of crude protein extracts from leaves of the transgenic plants with anti-Tfgd2 and anti-RsAFP2 antibodies exhibited an 8 and 9 kDa bands corresponding to size of the fusion gene and confirmed the expression of fusion protein. When the leaves of transgenic plants were challenged with Rhizoctonia solani and Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae pathogens, they showed enhanced levels of disease resistance along with resistance to the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera litura larvae compared to control. Our results demonstrate that Tfgd2-RsAFP2 fusion protein is effective in protecting the transgenic plants against fungal and insect pathogens.

HyLaGI features a nondeterministic simulation algorithm so it can calculate all possible qualitative different trajectories of models with uncertainties.
0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 Cloud Computing (CC); DInSAR; Earth surface deformation; Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS)        	We present an efficient Cloud Computing (CC) implementation of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) algorithm, which is an advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique for the generation of Earth surface displacement time series through distributed computing infrastructures. The rationale of our approach consists in properly distributing the large data volumes and the processing tasks involved in the P-SBAS chain among the available (virtual and/or physical) computing nodes of the CC infrastructure, so that each one of these elements can concurrentlywork on data that are physically stored on its own local volume. To do this, both an ad hocmanagement of the data flow and an appropriate scheduling of the parallel jobs have been also implemented to properly handle the high complexity of the P-SBAS workflow. The proposed solution allows minimizing the overall data transfer and network load, thus improving the P-SBAS efficiency and scalability within the exploited CCenvironments. The presented P-SBAS implementation has been extensively validated through two experimental analyses, which have been carried out by exploiting the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) resources. The former analysis involves the processing of a large (128 SAR images) COSMO-SkyMed dataset, which has been performed by exploiting up to 64 computing nodes, and is aimed at demonstrating the P-SBAS scalable performances. The latter allows us to show the P-SBAS capability to generate DInSAR results at a regional scale (150 000 km2 in Southern California) in a very short time (about 9 h), by simultaneously processing 18 ENVISAT frames that correspond to a total of 741 SAR images, exploiting in parallel 144 AWS computing nodes. The presented results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed P-SBASCCsolution, whichmay contribute to further extend the frontiers of the DInSAR investigation at a very large scale.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 Neuroscience ICU; Anxiety; Depression; Anger; Resilience; Informal caregiver        	Purpose: The purpose of the study is to examine the associations of patients' and their informal caregivers' psychosocial resiliency factors with their own and their partners' emotion domains (distress, anxiety, depression, and anger) after admission to the neuroscience intensive care unit (Neuro-ICU). Materials and methods: Eighty-three dyads of patients (total n= 87) and their informal caregivers (total n= 99) participated in this observational, cross-sectional study by self-reporting demographics and measures of resiliency factors (mindfulness [Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale Revised], coping [Measure of Coping Status-A], intimate bond [Intimate Bond Measure], self-efficacy [patients: General Self-Efficacy Scale; caregivers: Revised Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale]) and emotion domains (Emotion Thermometers) within 2 weeks of Neuro-ICU admission. Results: There were no differences between patients' and caregivers' levels of psychosocial resiliency, distress, or anxiety. Patients reported greater depression and anger relative to their caregivers. Overall, roughly half of patients (50.6%) and caregivers (42.4%) reported clinically significant emotional distress. Patients' and caregivers' own psychosocial resiliency factors were associated with their own, but not their partner's, emotion domains. Conclusions: Findings of high distress among both patients and caregivers at admission emphasize the importance of attending to the mental health of both patients and caregivers in the Neuro-ICU. As modifiable psychosocial resiliency factors were associated with emotion domains for both patients and caregivers, interventions to enhance these factors may ameliorate emotional distress among these vulnerable populations.

4	9	70	Civil 	 Construction Management  	 Building information modeling (BIM); Construction management; Laser scanner; Point cloud        	To raise the awareness and understanding about the building information modeling (BIM) and laser scanning tools and applications in construction industry, a questionnaire was administered to participants from different background and workplaces. The results indicate the participants' positive perceptions of employing such tools in their workplace. This study also reports on a case study using BIM and laser scanning tools on Teknopark Building in North Cyprus. For this purpose, a CADeyes camera was used to capture the building's 3D spatial and visual data, which were then analyzed using Revit to generate a 3D model. The outcomes revealed the efficient and effective use of these tools in the construction sector. The findings of this study, therefore, recommend designers and end-users to use these applications in order to meet the basic requirements of design and construction as well as to deal with the challenges such as errors, risks and costs of construction projects.
1	6	23	ECE 	 Electrical network  	 Resistance distance; Global cyclicity index; Cyclomatic number; Nordhaus-Gaddum-type result        	Being motivated in terms of mathematical concepts from the theory of electrical networks, Klein and Ivanciuc introduced and studied a new graph-theoretic cyclicity index-the global cyclicity index (Klein, lvanciuc, 2001). In this paper, by utilizing techniques from graph theory, electrical network theory and real analysis, we obtain some further results on this new cyclicity measure, including the strictly monotone increasing property, some lower and upper bounds, and some Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results. In particular, we establish a relationship between the global cyclicity index C(G) and the cyclomatic number mu(G) of a connected graph G with n vertices and m edges: m/n-1 mu(G) <= C(G) <= n/2 mu(G).

5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 Chinese; desmoglein-1 gene; mutation        	Recently, homozygous mutations in the desmoglein-1 (DSG1) gene and heterozygous mutation in the desmoplakin (DSP) gene have been demonstrated to be associated with severe dermatitis, multiple allergies and metabolic wasting (SAM) syndrome (Mendelian Inheritance in Man no. 615508). We aim to identify the molecular basis for a Chinese pedigree of SAM syndrome. A Chinese pedigree of SAM syndrome was subjected to mutation detection in the DSG1 gene. Sequence analysis of the DSG1 gene and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis for gene expression of DSG1 using cDNA derived from the epidermis of patients and controls were both performed. Skin biopsies were also taken from patients for pathological study and transmission electron microscopy observation. Novel homozygous splicing mutation c.1892-1delG in the exon-intron border of the DSG1 gene has been demonstrated to be associated with SAM syndrome. We report a new family of SAM syndrome of Asian decent and expand the spectrum of mutations in the DSG1 gene.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 academic medical center; Food and Drug Administration; mesh; revision surgery; sling; stress urinary incontinence        	AimsTo investigate the possible effects of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Public Health Notifications in 2008 and 2011 regarding surgical trends in transvaginal mesh (TVM) placement for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and related mesh revision surgery in Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) practice in tertiary care academic medical centers in the United States. MethodsSurgical volume for procedures performed primarily by FPMRS surgeons at eight academic institutions across the US was collected using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for stress urinary incontinence repair and revision surgeries from 2007 to 2013. SAS statistical software was used to assess for trends in the data. ResultsThere was a decrease in the use of synthetic mesh sling for the treatment of SUI at academic tertiary care centers over the past 7 years; however, this was not statistically significant. While the total number of surgical interventions for SUI remained stable, there was an increase in the utilization of autologous fascia pubovaginal slings (AFPVS). The number of mesh sling revision surgeries, including urethrolysis and removal or revision of slings, increased almost three-fold at these centers. ConclusionsThese observed trends suggest a possible effect of the FDA Public Health Notifications regarding TVM on surgical practice for SUI in academic centers, even though they did not specifically warn against the use of synthetic mesh for this indication. Indications for surgery, complications, and outcomes were not evaluated during this retrospective study. However, such data may provide alternative insights into reasons for the observed trends.

3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 Natural circulation; marine reactor; motion condition; thermal hydraulics        	A code PNCMC (Program for Natural Circulation under Motion Conditions) has been developed for natural circulation simulation of marine reactors. The code is based on one-dimensional two-fluid model in noninertial frame of reference. The body force term in the momentum equation is considered as a time dependent function, which consists of gravity and inertial force induced by three-dimensional ship motion. Staggered mesh, finite volume method, semi-implicit first order upwind scheme and Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) method are used to discretize and solve two-phase mass, momentum and energy equations. Single-phase natural circulation experiments under rolling condition performed in Institute of nuclear and new energy technology of Tsinghua University and two-phase natural circulation experiments under rolling condition performed by Tan and colleagues are used to validate PNCMC. The validation results indicate that PNCMC is capable to investigate the single-phase and two-phase natural circulation under rolling motion.
5	37	109	Medical 	 Myelofibrosis  	 single nucleotide polymorphisms; myeloproliferative neoplasms; epidemiology        	Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are rare diseases that include classic entities; polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis. In this short report, minor allele frequencies of common MPN mutations are compared between the Irish blood donor population and other populations of European descent using data from the Haplotype Map project. The Affymetrix array 6.0 platform was utilised identifying nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and six proxy SNPs. The variability of allele frequencies for MPN mutations could account for the different incidence rates seen between populations of European ancestry, giving a better understanding of the genetic predisposition to MPNs.

6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 ammonium; nitrate; Oryza sativa; OsMT3 gene; oxidative stress        	A cDNA sequence OsMT3 was initially isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of ammonium-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves, which was further confirmed by Northern blot to be highly ammonium-up-regulated as compared to nitrate. Its full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR, and in silico analysis reveals that the cDNA includes an open reading frame of 186 bp and encodes a rice metallothionein type 3 peptide. Northern blotting analysis showed that OsMT3 gene predominantly expressed in rice leaves, weakly in stems, and barely in buds and roots. The gene transcripts in leaves were significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), low temperature, NaCl and Cu2+, but not by Pb2+. Activities of three anti-oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidases) and two non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione) little differed in ammonium-and nitrate-fed rice leaves, indicating that the induced OsMT3 expression was not mediated by ammonium-elicited oxidative signals.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Maternal gatekeeping; cultural gatekeeping; involved fatherhood; father-child involvement; South Africa        	Involved and caring fatherhood contributes to the health and wellbeing of children, women and men. The corollary is also true - men, women and children are affected when fathers are not involved or supportive of their children. Many factors affect fathers' involvement, including women's attitudes, the history and nature of the relationship between mother and father, and the cultural context. This study explores gatekeeping and its impact on father involvement among Black South Africans in rural KwaZulu-Natal. Among married couples, gatekeeping occurs with respect to childcare and housework through women's attempts to validate their maternal identity according to socially and culturally constructed gender roles. Among unmarried, non-resident parents, women control father-child contact and involvement, with mothers and/or their families either facilitating or inhibiting father involvement. In this context, we found that cultural gatekeeping had a huge impact on father involvement, with the non-payment of inhlawulo or lobola regulating father-child involvement. In a country like South Africa, where there is high non-marital fertility and father-child non-residence, future research, parenting and family programmes should focus on strategies that encourage positive paternal involvement as well as maternal and cultural support for father involvement, regardless of parental relationship and residence status.
5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 Particulate matter; Human normal keratinocytes; Next-generation sequencing        	"Ambient air pollution is becoming more severe worldwide, posing a serious threat to human health. Fine airborne particles of particulate matter (PM2.5) show higher cytotoxicity than other coarse fractions. Indeed, PM2.5 induces cardiovascular or respiratory damage; however, few studies have evaluated the detrimental effect of PM2.5 to normal human skin. We used a next-generation sequencing-based (RNA-Seq) method with transcriptome and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to determine the harmful influences of PM2.5 on human normal epidermal keratinocytes. DAVID analysis showed that the most significantly enriched GO terms were associated with epidermis-related biological processes such as ""epidermis development (GO: 0008544)"" and ""keratinocyte differentiation (GO: 0030216)"", suggesting that PM2.5 has some deleterious effects to the human epidermis. In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted inflammation-related signaling as one of the major PM2.5-induced signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokines as upstream regulators with symptoms similar to psoriasis as downstream effects. PM2.5 caused considerable changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and psoriatic skin disease-related genes, might lead to epidermal dysfunctions. Our results might help to understand the mechanism of air pollution-induced skin barrier perturbation and contribute to the development of a new strategy for the prevention or recovery of the consequent damage.

2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 Gender roles; Masculinity; Person perception; Sexual orientation; Nonverbal behavior        	In intercourse between men, one of the partners typically assumes the role of an insertive partner (top) while the other assumes a receptive role (bottom). Although some research suggests that the perceptions of potential partners' sexual roles in gay men's relationships can affect whether a man will adopt the role of top or bottom during sexual intercourse, it remains unclear whether sexual roles could be perceived accurately by na < ve observers. In Study 1, we found that na < ve observers were able to discern men's sexual roles from photos of their faces with accuracy that was significantly greater than chance guessing. Moreover, in Study 2, we determined that the relationship between men's perceived and actual sexual roles was mediated by perceived masculinity. Together, these results suggest that people rely on perceptions of characteristics relevant to stereotypical male-female gender roles and heterosexual relationships to accurately infer sexual roles in same-sex relationships. Thus, same-sex relationships and sexual behavior may be perceptually framed, understood, and possibly structured in ways similar to stereotypes about opposite-sex relationships, suggesting that people may rely on these inferences to form accurate perceptions.

3	6	58	MAE 	 Thermodynamics  	 Al-Cu-Mg alloy; Dissolution; Solute cluster; Fatigue; Microstructure        	Quantitative and qualitative analyses on the dissolution behavior of various size Cu-Mg co-clusters near a fatigue crack tip of underaged Al-Cu-Mg alloy during cyclic loading were performed by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT). Results showed that the driving force for dissolution of Cu-Mg co-clusters was increased with the increase of the co-clusters size. Therefore, Cu Mg co-clusters in smaller sizes were easier to dissolve. The number density of small Cu Mg co-clusters (20-50 atoms) increased and that of Cu-Mg co-clusters (50-200 atoms) reduced in the fatigue crack tip region during cyclic deformation. This was because that the large cluster could be repeated cut by moving dislocations to two or more parts of smaller clusters. Besides, the small clusters containing 20-100 atoms also might re-form after fatigue crack propagation (FCP) test in the fatigue crack tip region. The average equivalent radius of large Cu-Mg co-clusters (100-200 atoms) decreased from 1.38 nm to 131 nm during fatigue deformation in 170 degrees C/1 h sample. But there was no obvious difference of that in 170 degrees C/8 h sample. This result indicated that the dissolution of the large co-clusters in 170 degrees C/1 h sample was more violent than 170 degrees C/8 h sample. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 control; utilitarian consumption; problem-solving tendency        	This research investigates how the fundamental desire for control affects product acquisition. The authors propose that consumers compensate for a loss of perceived control by buying utilitarian products (e.g., household cleaning agents) because of these products' association with problem solving, a quality that promotes a sense of control. Study 1 demonstrates this basic effect in a field setting involving real purchases, while studies 2 and 3 show that framing a product as utilitarian (vs. hedonic) moderates the effect of control on purchase intentions. Study 4 shows that a generalized problem-solving tendency mediates the effect of control on eagerness to pursue utilitarian consumption. Given the pervasiveness and ease of using product acquisition as a means to cope with psychological threat, this research has important implications for theory and practice.
0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 Operating systems; abstractions; reconfigurability; resource management; analog computing        	as the deceleration of processor scaling due to Moore's law accelerates research in new types of computing structures, the need arises for rethinking operating systems paradigms. Traditionally, an operating system is a layer between hardware and applications and its primary function is in managing hardware resources and providing a common abstraction to applications. How does this function apply, however, to new types of computing paradigms? Are operating systems even needed for these new structures? This paper revisits operating system functionality for new computing paradigms. The structure of these new computers is uncertain as there are many possibilities such as neuromorphic, bio-inspired, adiabatic, reversible, approximate, quantum, combinations of these and others unforeseen [1]. We do know, however, that whatever these new computers will be, there will be some need to manage their resources, to provide programming support, to partition, scale, and connect them and to deal with (partial) failure, along with other traditional operating system's functionality. There might also be some new functionality, such as creating abstract control loops, reasoning about precision, new ways of reconfiguring, and more. We strongly believe that even if traditional operating systems functionality evolves, that the need for operating systems will remain in the new era of computing.

2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 appetitive competition motivation; socialization; gender role orientation; upbringing style; women's football; motivation; gender        	The ability to produce peak performance plays a decisive role in the success of athletes in competitive contest situations. Levels of appetitive competition motivation (ACM), i.e., the desire to defeat an opponent independent of secondary reinforcing factors, were assessed in professional female football/soccer players in the premier and regional leagues, using club level as the measurement of sport success. Furthermore, the influence of social environments predominantly encouraging masculine and competitive play behavior and the players' perceptions of their own gender role orientations were investigated. Ninety female football players from the German premier league (44) and regional leagues (46) participated (age: M = 24, SD = 5 years). Questionnaires ascertaining ACM and self-perceptions of gender via gender-role stereotypes, childhood play behavior and style of upbringing were utilized. Premier league athletes showed a significantly greater inclination toward direct sporting confrontations. Almost 50% of the variance in ACM between the premier and regional league athletes was determined by modern upbringing style and the development of gender roles not corresponding to classic female gender stereotypes. The results emphasize the significance of ACM as an important facet in competitive sports and illustrate the influence of socialization on athletic performance.
5	32	104	Medical 	 Lymphoma  	 diffuse large B cell lymphoma; long noncoding RNAs; microarray        	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in many tumors. To find novel targets for study of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), our team performed genome-wide analyses of lncRNA expression in 5 DLBCL cell lines using the 4*180K Agilent lncRNA Chip system, and in normal B cells. Five lncRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified via false discovery rate and fold-change filtering. Potential targets correlated with DLBCL were recognized via gene ontology and pathway analysis. Establishment of the co-expression network was done using Cytoscape. In total, 1053 lncRNAs and 4391 mRNAs were dysregulated in DLBCL cells, being comparing with normal B cells. The results suggested that the expressions of the 5 lncRNAs were consistent with the chip results. Several terms including the cell cycle, apoptosis, B cell receptor and NF-kappa B signaling pathways were important in the progression of DLBCL. The chromosome locations of a few lncRNAs and the associated coexpressed genes were demonstrated by cis-regulatory gene analyses. The results of trans-analyses showed that multiple transcription factors regulated lncRNA and gene expression. Those outstanding lncRNAs in each group were implicated in the regulation of the TF-lncRNA-target gene network. Our study identified a set of lncRNAs differentially expressed in DLBCL cells.
2	17	50	Psychology  	 Attention  	 graphene; ionic liquid; non-covalently modification; poly(vinyl alcohol)        	How to preserve the structure integrity of graphene while enhance its dispersion and compatibility in matrix attracts the attention of researchers in graphene/polymer nanocomposite field. In this paper, methacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC), a kind of ionic liquids, was first used to non-covalently functionalize graphene in the process of graphene oxide (GO) reduction. The as-modified graphene (DMC-rGO) was further incorporated into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrix by solution casting technique to fabricate DMC-rGO/PVA composites. The structure and properties of the obtained DMC-rGO were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Raman test. The results showed that graphene could be successfully modified by DMC through ionic- interaction and the structure integrity of the graphene could be reserved by this non-covalently approach. Furthermore, after co-reduction process, some hydroxyl groups were introduced into DMC-rGO. In virtue of these intrinsic properties of DMC-rGO, the fabricated DMC-rGO/PVA composites exhibit considerable enhancements in mechanical properties and remarkable improvements in thermal stability, as well as the enhancement in electrical conductivity at low DMC-rGO loading. This simple modification approach gives a new opportunity to improve the performances of graphene/polymer composites. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45006.
5	45	117	Medical 	 Psoriasis  	 Psoriasis; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Therapy        	The coexistence of psoriasis with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been reported in limited case series, raising hypotheses about shared pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, important differences regarding treatment do exist. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of psoriasis in a defined cohort of lupus patients. Patients with psoriasis were retrieved from the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic from its inception in 1970 up to 2015. Charts were hand-searched to collect information concerning demographic, clinical, and therapeutic variables. Patients were matched with non-psoriasis lupus patients to identify the impact of supervening psoriasis on lupus activity, damage accrual, and venous thromboembolic (VTEs) and cardiovascular events (CVEs). Psoriasis was diagnosed in 63 patients (49 females, 14 males) for a prevalence of 3.46% (63/1823). The male-to-female ratio was significantly higher in non-psoriasis patients (0.286 vs. 0.138, p = 0.017). Plaque psoriasis was the most prominent type (55/63, 87.3%) whereas three patients had pustular disease; one had psoriatic arthritis. Nine patients (14.3%) were administered systemic treatment with methotrexate (n = 5), azathioprine (n = 1), ustekinumab (n = 3), and etanercept (n = 1). Psoriasis was definitely deteriorated by hydroxychloroquine in one patient. There was no significant impact of psoriasis on disease activity, damage accrual, VTEs, and CVEs. The prevalence of psoriasis was twice as high as that of the general Canadian population in this lupus cohort. Plaque psoriasis was the most prominent subtype, and topical treatment was adequate in the majority of patients. Supervening psoriasis had no significant impact on lupus activity and damage accrual.
5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 conformational epitopes; house dust mite allergen; immunotherapy; mimotopes        	Mimotope mapping enables the characterization of allergen epitopes for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In the present study, a phage display peptide library was used for mimotope mapping based on the binding of antibodies against the recombinant group 5 allergen from the house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f 5), an arthropod that causes indoor allergies worldwide. When three monoclonal anti-Der f 5 antibodies were used for biopanning, seven mimotopes were identified. Their common subsequence was '---[-A][-T] W[-S] H[HSFW][LM][PSKR] [TLV][AST] -[DP][-L] -'. When analyzed in combination with predicted discontinous epitopes, amino acids P2, K3, K4, H5, F11, F13, L14, R72, T77, L79, R84, T39, F40, P44, T45 and K46 were identified as key residues in conformational epitopes of Der f 5. Therefore, the seven mimotopes or modification of the key amino acids may facilitate the development of blocking antibodies or epitope-specific immunotherapies for mite allergy.
5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 mindfulness; prevention; education; dissemination; implementation        	College is a critical time in which individuals experience transition and stress, and may experience subthreshold or clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression. In addition, educational contexts offer a unique opportunity to serve the needs of a diverse group of students who may experience additional stressors related to experiences with discrimination; acculturative stress; financial strain; and balancing family, work, and school demands. Therefore, college appears to be an ideal time for students to learn about evidence-based skills to use in response to anxiety and depression. However, there are multiple barriers that may make it less likely that evidence-based skills and services are available to or utilized by students, including lack of funding and services available on campus, as well as concerns about mental health stigma. This study examines the preliminary acceptability and effectiveness of an acceptance-based behavioral stress/anxiety management workshop for university students on a diverse urban campus. Results indicate that participants found the workshop to be acceptable and helpful. Mixed-effect regression models examining symptom and impairment measures at preworkshop, 1-week follow-up, and 4-week follow-up showed a significant effect for time on anxious arousal, general anxiety symptoms, and social anxiety, but no significant effect for time on impairment. Implications and future directions for mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches in educational contexts are discussed.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Infant/toddler; Early intervention; Maternal depression; Child disability; Self-efficacy        	Objective A higher rate of depressive symptoms is found among mothers of children with disabilities compared to other parents. However, there is a lack of study of mothers with children < 3 years of age participating in Early Intervention (EI) programs. This study aims to more fully describe the extent of mood disorders in these mothers including estimated prevalence, severity and factors associated with maternal mental health, using gold standard clinical diagnostic and symptom measures, and test models associating depressive symptoms with contextual factors and child behavior. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 women who had at least one child enrolled in EI. Mothers were interviewed and completed reliable, valid measures to evaluate mental health, health status, family conflict, parent-child interaction, self-efficacy, social support, child behavioral problems, hardship, endangerment, and child disability. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were performed. Results We found 8 % of participants met all criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with 44 % of the sample reporting a past episode and 43 % endorsing recurrent episodes. Using the CES-D to assess depressive symptom severity approximately 34 % of mothers screened in a clinically significant range. Using linear regression to predict severity of current depressive symptoms demonstrated that current depression severity was primarily predicted by poorer maternal health status, lower self-efficacy and past MDE (p < 0.05). Conclusions for practice A brief assessment of maternal mood, health and self-efficacy are important factors to assess when evaluating how to support mothers of children in EI.
3	2	54	MAE 	 Manufacturing engineering  	 subsurface defects; laser induced damage; confocal fluorescence microscopy; fused silica        	Subsurface defects of polished fused silica optics are responsible for igniting laser damage in high power laser system. A non destructive measurement technique is developed to detect subsurface photoluminescence defects of fused silica. The fused silica samples polished by different vendors are applied to characterization of subsurface defects and measurement of damage performance. Subsurface photoluminescence defects of fused silica are evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscopy system. Laser induced damage threshold and damage density are measured by 355 nm nanosecond pulse laser. The results show a great differential subsurface quality of fused silica samples. Laser induced damage performance has a good correlation with subsurface defects. This paper shows a new non destructive measurement technique to detect photoluminescence defects on the subsurface layer of polished fused silica. It is very valuable to increasing laser damage performance and improving production-manufacturing engineering of optics.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Waste heat recovery; Turbocompounding; Internal combustion engine; Engine analytical model; Parametric study        	Turbocompounding is an important technique to recover waste heat from engine exhaust and reduce CO2 emission. This paper presents a parametric study of turbocompound diesel engine based on analytical model. An analytical model was developed to investigate the influence of system parameters on the engine fuel consumption. The model is based on thermodynamics knowledge and empirical models, which can consider the impacts of each parameter independently. The effects of turbine efficiency, back pressure, exhaust temperature, pressure ratio and engine speed on the recovery energy, pumping loss and engine fuel reductions were studied. Results show that turbine efficiency, exhaust temperature and back pressure has great influence on the fuel reduction and optimal power turbine (PT) expansion ratio. However, engine operation speed has little impact on the fuel savings obtained by turbocompounding. The interaction mechanism between the PT recovery power and engine pumping loss is presented in the paper. Due to the nonlinear characteristic of turbine power, there is an optimum value of PT expansion ratio to achieve largest power gain. At the end, the fuel saving potential of high performance turbocompound engine and the requirements for it are proposed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This procedure can be complicated by stroke or silent cerebral embolism. Online measurement of microembolic signals (MESs) by transcranial Doppler (TCD) may be useful for characterizing thromboembolic burden during PVI. In this prospective multicenter trial, we investigated the burden, characteristics, and composition of MES during left atrial catheter ablation using a variety of catheter technologies. Materials and methods: PVI was performed in a total of 42 patients using the circular-shaped multielectrode pulmonary vein ablation catheter (PVAC) technology in 23, an irrigated radiofrequency (IRF) in 14, and the cryoballoon (CB) technology in 5 patients. TCD was used to detect the total MES burden and sustained thromboembolic showers (TESs) of >30 s. During TES, the site of ablation within the left atrium was registered. MES composition was classified manually into solid, gaseous, or equivocal by off-line expert assessment. Results: The total MES burden was higher when using IRF compared to CB (2,336 +/- 1,654 vs. 593 +/- 231; p = 0.007) and showed a tendency toward a higher burden when using IRF compared to PVAC (2,336 +/- 1,654 vs. 1,685 +/- 2,255; p = 0.08). TES occurred more often when using PVAC compared to IRF (1.5 +/- 2 vs. 0.4 +/- 1.3; p = 0.04) and most frequently when ablation was performed close to the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV). Of the MES, 17.004 (23%) were characterized as definitely solid, 13.204 (18%) as clearly gaseous, and 44.366 (59%) as equivocal. Discussion: We investigated the burden and characteristics of MES during left atrial catheter ablation for AF. All ablation techniques applied in this study generated a relevant number of MES. There was a significant difference in total MES burden using IRF compared to CB and a tendency toward a higher burden using IRF compared to PVAC. The highest TES burden was found in the PVAC group, particularly during ablation close to the LSPV. The composition of thromboembolic particles was balanced. The impact of MES, TES, and composition of thromboembolic particles on neurological outcome needs to be evaluated further.
2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 net-zero energy buildings; existing buildings; energy efficiency strategies; energy modeling simulation        	Recent global developments in awareness and concerns about environmental problems have led to reconsidering built environment approaches and construction techniques. One of the alternatives is the principle of low/zero-energy buildings. This study investigates the potentials of energy savings in an existing multi-story building in the Mediterranean region in order to achieve net-zero energy as a solution to increasing fossil fuel prices. The Colored building at the Faculty of Architecture, Eastern Mediterranean University, Cyprus was chosen as a target of this study to be investigated and analyzed in order to know how energy efficiency strategies could be applied to the building to reduce annual energy consumption. Since this research objective is to develop a strategy to achieve net-zero energy in existing buildings, case study and problem solving methodologies were applied in this research in order to evaluate the building design in a qualitative manner through observations, in addition to a quantitative method through an energy modeling simulation to achieve desirable results which address the problems. After optimizing the building energy performance, an alternative energy simulation was made of the building in order to make an energy comparison analysis, which leads to reliable conclusions. These methodologies and the strategies used in this research can be applied to similar buildings in order to achieve net-zero energy goals.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 Dexmedetomidine; 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA); Microglia M2 polarization; Arginase-1 (Arg-1); STAT6        	Microglia have undergone extensive characterization and have been shown to present distinct phenotypes, such as the M1 or M2 phenotypes, depending on their stimuli. As a highly specific neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) can be used to further our understanding of the immune response in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a centrally selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, performs very well as an anti-anxiety medication, sedative and analgesic. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DEX on 6-OHDA-induced microglial polarization. Our results indicate that treatment with 6-OHDA promotes microglial polarization toward the M1 state in BV2 microglia cells by increasing the release of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which can be prevented by pretreatment with DEX. In addition, we found that 6-OHDA blocked IL-4-mediated microglial M2 polarization by suppressing expression of the microglial M2 markers arginase-1 (Arg-1), resistin-like alpha (Retnla/Fizz1), and chitinase 3-like 3 (Chi3l3/Ym1), which could be ameliorated by pretreatment with DEX. Notably, the inhibitory effects of 6-OHDA on IL-4-mediated induction of the anti-inflammatory marker genes IL-10, IL-13, and transforming growth factor-beta 2 could be significantly alleviated by pretreatment with DEX in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). Mechanistically, alternations in the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 were involved in this process. These findings suggest that administration of DEX has the potential to interrupt the process of microgliosis in PD.

6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 C difficile; Infection; Colonization; Asymptomatic; Carriage        	Background: The Clostridium difficile rate in symptomatic patients represents both those with C difficile infection (CDI) and those with colonization. To predict the extent of CDI overdiagnosis, we compared the asymptomatic colonization rate to the symptomatic positivity rate in hospitalized patients using nucleic acid testing. Methods: Between July 2014 and April 2015, formed stool samples were collected from asymptomatic patients after admission to 3 hospital wards at the Stanford Hospital. Stool samples from symptomatic patients with suspected CDI in the same wards were collected for testing per provider order. The GeneXpert C. difficile tcdB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was performed on all stool samples and PCR cycle threshold was used as a measure of genomic equivalents. Chart review was performed to obtain clinical history and medication exposure. Results: We found an asymptomatic C. difficile carriage rate of 11.8% (43/365) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.515.1%) and a positivity rate in symptomatic patients of 15.4% (54/351) (95% CI, 11.6-19.2%; P = 0.19). The median PCR cycle thresholds was not significantly different between asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic positives (29.5 versus 27.3; P = 0.07). Among asymptomatic patients, 11.6% (5/43) of carriers and 8.4% (27/322; P = 0.56) of noncarriers subsequently became symptomatic CDI suspects within the same hospitalization. Single and multivariate analysis did not identify any demographic or clinical factors as being significantly associated with C difficile carriage. Conclusions: Asymptomatic C difficile carriage rate was similar to symptomatic positivity rate. This suggests the majority of PCR-positive results in symptomatic patients are likely due to C. difficile colonization. Disease specific biomarkers are needed to accurately diagnose patients with C difficile disease. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Short sleep; Bone metabolism; Cortical bone thickness; Leptin-sympathetic nervous system        	Background: Sleep has been reported to be an important factor in bone metabolism, and sympathetic nervous system activity has been reported to regulate bone metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the association between sleep, sympathetic nervous system activity, and bone mass. Methods: The study subjects were 221 individuals (108 males; 113 females; mean age: 55.1 +/- 7.0 years) divided into two groups: those who slept for less than 6 h a day (short sleep [SS] group), and those who slept 6 h or longer (normal sleep [NS] group). The groups were compared with regard to lifestyle, cortical bone thickness, cancellous bone density, bone metabolism markers, blood leptin levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity as evaluated by heart rate variability analysis. Results: Significant differences were observed between the two groups in cortical bone thickness, blood TRACP-5b, and leptin levels. The L/H ratio (an index of sympathetic nervous system activity) was higher in the SS group than in the NS group. Significant negative correlations were observed between cortical bone thickness and both the L/H ratio and leptin levels, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the L/H ratio and leptin levels. Conclusions: Short sleep was associated with a decline in cortical bone thickness due to the promotion of bone resorption and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in the middle-aged group. Leptin levels and cortical bone thickness were found to be closely related, suggesting that cortical bone mass may be regulated via interaction with the leptin-sympathetic nervous system.

3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Diesel engine; Methanol; Dual fuel; Unevenness degree; Cylinder-to-cylinder variation        	The methanol fuel used in diesel engine can reduce the emissions effectively, while the performance of engine keeps unchanged or even improved, the study of methanol used in diesel engine is paid more and more attention. Experiments were conducted in a 4-cylinder, turbocharged direct injection diesel engine fueled with diesel/methanol dual fuel (DMDF). In the experiment, methanol was injected into inlet duct by two low-pressure injectors, and directly mixed with intake air before entering the engine. The diesel fuel was directly injected in cylinder. The methanol substitution percent (MSP), intake air temperature and engine speed were changed to investigate the unevenness degree (UED) cylinder-to-cylinder. The experimental results show that the UED of engine increases with the increase of MSP under various engine loads, the COVpp increases with MSP under low engine load, and the COVpp curves vary very little under low MSP under 75% and 100% engine load, but a significantly rise appeared when MSP further increases. The UED gradually increases with the increase of intake air temperature, and it is usually less than 8% when intake air temperatures lower than 80 degrees C under 40% MSP. It suggests it is helpful to decrease the UED when the intake air temperature is in the range of 35-80 degrees C as MSP less than 40%. In addition, the difference of pressure between cylinder-to-cylinder decreases with the increase of engine speed, it can be considered raising MSP at high engine speed in order to gain better engine economy.

Detailed comparisons and results are presented to verify, the utility of proposed realizations. The catalog of proposed realizations is a first attempt and is expected to be useful for testing newly developed circuits based on dual-X second generation current conveyor. Each of the first fourteen proposed realizations uses four ICs. One three IC based implementation is further given making the total count fifteen. Some additional features are also explored which further enhance the versatility of DXCCII The paper further presents a novel and compact quadrature oscillator to verify the applicability of the proposed realizations. Single resistance control of the frequency of oscillation is also demonstrated by employing the new gain-variable DXCCII. Experimental results are also included along with simulation results to validate the proposed theory and its practical significance.
6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 constraint based; metabolism; model; systems biology        	Metabolism is a vital cellular process, and its malfunction is a major contributor to human disease. Metabolic networks are complex and highly interconnected, and thus systems-level computational approaches are required to elucidate and understand metabolic genotype-phenotype relationships. We have manually reconstructed the global human metabolic network based on Build 35 of the genome annotation and a comprehensive evaluation of >50 years of legacy data (i.e., bibliomic data). Herein we describe the reconstruction process and demonstrate how the resulting genome-scale (or global) network can be used (i) for the discovery of missing information, (ii) for the formulation of an in silico model, and (iii) as a structured context for analyzing high-throughput biological data sets. Our comprehensive evaluation of the literature revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. Mathematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. Integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the context of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of functional metabolic states. These results highlight some of the applications enabled by the reconstructed human metabolic network. The establishment of this network represents an important step toward genome-scale human systems biology.

2	17	50	Psychology  	 Attention  	 Consumer behaviour; consumer psychology; sponsorship; team identification        	Research question: Scholars have paid little attention to consumer response to the termination of a sponsorship. The purpose of this study was to examine the reaction of fans of a professional cycling team to a sponsorship terminating, which ultimately led to the team disbanding.Research methods: The research purpose was pursued through digital ethnography (via message boards and weblog), examining the case of Basque professional cycling fans. Comments were analysed to understand fans' reaction to the 2013 cessation of Euskaltel-Euskadi, a Basque professional cycling team, after its sponsor, Euskaltel, exited the partnership.Results and findings: Fan reaction to Euskaltel ending its sponsorship was somewhat paradoxical, in that the terminated sponsorship ultimately led to the team disbanding, yet fans appeared to be appreciative of Euskaltel. They continued to celebrate the team's corporate sponsor colour as they mourned the end of Euskaltel-Euskadi and questioned the future of Basque cycling. This reaction is made more logical by understanding the long-term duration of the partnership, and how Euskaltel's support of the team for nearly two decades led to the intermeshing of the team and its sponsor, thus avoiding negative sentiment.Implications: This study makes a meaningful contribution to the sponsorship literature, particularly sponsorship termination. This study is one of the first to examine consumer response to sponsorship termination in a real-world setting, and suggests a potential legacy effect of long-term sponsorship, such that fan reaction to a long-term sponsorship terminating may not be negative, especially if fans understand the sponsor's contribution over time.

In this paper, a behavior experiment was used to collect data instead of questionnaire in traditional research in garment sensory perception. The results show the main effect of silhouette element and interaction effects between elements on sensory perception were quite different. The information integration in garment silhouette sensory perception was differed in different emotional. The integration model and mathematical model constructed in this paper can provide a basis for integrating other perception information such as color and hand feeling in sensory evaluation of garment.

5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 economy; recession; employee stress; strain; satisfaction        	Across the globe, economic fluctuations have taken their toll on both organizations and employees, particularly during sustained recessions. Surprisingly, little research, however, has directly investigated the effects of recessions on employees. As such, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of specific recession-related stressors on employee outcomes (strain and satisfaction). We investigated an archival data set of 7666 individuals collected as part of the Workplace Employment Relations Study for relations among recession-related stressors with strain and job satisfaction variables. We found that recession-related stressors were significantly related to both strain and satisfaction. More specifically, certain recession-related stressors (e.g. increased workload and reorganization of work) were more strongly related to strain and satisfaction than others. These results imply the need for greater attention to stress management strategies aimed at helping both employees and their organizations cope with the human costs of economic recessions.

5	3	75	Medical 	 Ankylosing Spondylitis  	 Autoantibodies; Children; Diagnosis; SmD1-amino-acid 83-119 Peptide; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus        	Background: SmD1-amino-acid 83-119 peptide (SmD1(83-119)) is the major epitope of Smith (Sm) antigen, which is specific for adult systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The anti-SmD1(83-119) antibody has exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than anti-Sm antibody in diagnosing adult SLE. However, the utility of anti-SmD1(83-119) antibodies remains unclear in children with SLE (cSLE). This study aimed to assess the characteristics of anti-SmD1(83-119) antibody in the diagnosis of cSLE. Methods: Samples from 242 children with different rheumatological and immunological disorders, including autoimmune diseases (SLE [n = 46] and ankylosing spondylitis [AS, n = 11]), nonautoimmune diseases (Henoch-Schonlein purpura [HSP, n = 60], idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura [n = 27], hematuria [n = 59], and arthralgia [n = 39]) were collected from Shanghai Children's Medical Center from March 6, 2012 to February 27, 2014. Seventy age-and sex-matched patients were enrolled in this study as the negative controls. All the patients' sera were analyzed for the anti-SmD1(83-119), anti-Sm, anti-U1-nRNP, anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), anti-nucleosome, anti-SSA/Ro60, anti-SSA/Ro52, anti-SSB, anti-Scl-70, and anti-histone antibodies using the immunoblotting assay. The differences in sensitivity and specificity between anti-SmD1(83-119) and anti-Sm antibodies were compared by Chi-square test. The correlations between anti-SmD1(83-119) and other auto-antibodies were analyzed using the Spearman's correlation analysis. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Thirty-six out of 46 patients with cSLE were found to be positive for anti-SmD1(83-119), while 12 patients from the cSLE cohort were found to be positive for anti-Sm. Compared to cSLE, it has been shown that anti-SmD1(83-119) was only detected in 27.3% of patients with AS and 16.7% of patients with HSP. In comparison with anti-Sm, it has been demonstrated that anti-SmD1(83-119) had a higher sensitivity (78.3% vs. 26.1%, chi(2) = 25.1, P < 0.05) and a lower specificity (90.8% vs. 100%, chi(2) = 13.6, P < 0.05) in the diagnosis of cSLE. Further analysis revealed that anti-SmD1(83-119) antibodies were positively correlated with anti-dsDNA, anti-nucleosome, and anti-histone antibodies in cSLE. Moreover, it has been clearly shown that anti-SmD1(83-119) was more sensitive than anti-Sm in discriminating autoimmune diseases from nonautoimmune disorders in patients with arthralgia or hematuria. Conclusions: Measurement of anti-SmD1(83-119) in patients with cSLE has a higher sensitivity and a marginally lower specificity than anti-Sm. It has been suggested that inclusion of anti-SmD1(83-119) testing in the integrated laboratory diagnosis of cSLE may significantly improve the overall sensitivity in child populations.

In the present analysis, the typical forms of hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity functions proposed by Witelski are considered. In particular, the travelling wave solutions for Richard's equation with nonlinear diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity are presented. The governing nonlinear partial differential equation is solved by modified F-expansion method with the help of symbolic computation system Mathcmatica. Soliton-like solutions are obtained and its physical interpretation is considered for the specific initial value problem. The obtained solutions reveal that the method is a very effective and powerful tool for solving various nonlinear partial differential equations arising in mathematical physics. (C) 2015 The Authors.

1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 Pound-Drever-Hall; laser frequency stabilisation; Fabry-Perot; heterodyne; modulation        	Laser frequency stabilisation in the telecommunications band was realised using the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) error signal. The transmission spectrum of the Fabry-Perot cavity was used as opposed to the traditionally used reflected spectrum. A comparison was done using an analogue as well as a digitally implemented system. This study forms part of an initial step towards developing a portable optical time and frequency standard. The frequency discriminator used in the experimental setup was a fibre-based Fabry-Perot etalon. The phase sensitive system made use of the optical heterodyne technique to detect changes in the phase of the system. A lock-in amplifier was used to filter and mix the input signals to generate the error signal. This error signal may then be used to generate a control signal via a PID controller. An error signal was realised at a wavelength of 1556 nm which correlates to an optical frequency of 1.926 THz. An implementation of the analogue PDH technique yielded an error signal with a bandwidth of 6.134 GHz, while a digital implementation yielded a bandwidth of 5.774 GHz.
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 anorexia nervosa; rejection sensitivity; interpretation bias; transdiagnostic        	Patients with anorexia nervosa experience increased sensitivity to the risk of social rejection. The aims of this study were to assess the interpretation of ambiguous social scenarios depicting the risk of rejection and to examine the relationship between interpretation biases and clinical symptoms. Thirty-five women with anorexia nervosa and 30 healthy eaters completed clinical questionnaires, alongside a sentence completion task. This task required participants to generate completions to ambiguous social scenarios and to endorse their best completion. Responses were rated as being negative, neutral or positive. Patients endorsed more negative interpretations and fewer neutral and positive interpretations compared with healthy eaters. The frequency of endorsed negative interpretations correlated with depression, anxiety and fear of weight gain and body disturbance. A negative interpretation bias towards social stimuli is present in women with anorexia nervosa and correlates with clinical symptoms. Interventions aimed at reducing this bias could improve illness prognosis. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

Objective To identify genetic variants associated with challenge-proven peanut allergy. Methods We carried out a GWAS comparing 73 infants with challenge-proven IgE-mediated peanut allergy against 148 non-allergic infants (all similar to 1 year old). We tested a total of 3.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as imputed HLA alleles and amino acids. Replication was assessed by de novo genotyping in a panel of additional 117 cases and 380 controls, and in silico testing in two independent GWAS cohorts. Results We identified 21 independent associations at P <= 5 x 10 (5) but were unable to replicate these. The most significant HLA association was the previously reported amino acid variant located at position 71, within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRB1 (P = 2 x 10(-4)). Our study therefore reproduced previous findings for the association between peanut allergy and HLA-DRB1 in this Australian population. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Genetic determinants for challenge-proven peanut allergy include alleles at the HLA-DRB1 locus.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 Service reputation; trust; evidence theory; AmI        	Service reputation is a key factor for service selection and service composition in Service-Oriented Ambient Intelligence systems. Hence, service reputation computing should fully reflect the feature of multi-rating fusion and the utility value dynamic attenuation characters of the rating. The paper combines D-S evidence theory with dynamic attenuation and puts forward a service reputation computing algorithm based on multi-rating fusion, which is adapted to the Ambient Intelligence systems. First, a layered computing model of the service reputation is given. Then, a mechanism of dynamic attenuation based on time windows, an objective rating and advertisement honesty rating of service, and a user credibility computing algorithm are presented. Afterward, the rating information is combined with the D-S evidence theory to raise an aggregation algorithm of the service general reputation for the Ambient Intelligence environments. Finally, a prototype test is carried out to verify the effectiveness and availability of the model together with the algorithms.

6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Platelets; genetics; PAR4; PCTP; eQTL        	Platelet activation in response to stimulation of the Protease Activated Receptor 4 (PAR4) receptor differs by race. One factor that contributes to this difference is the expression level of Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein (PCTP), a regulator of platelet PAR4 function. We have conducted an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis that identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the expression level of platelet genes. This analysis revealed 26 SNPs associated with the expression level of PCTP at genome-wide significance (p < 5x10-8). Using annotation from ENCODE and other public data we prioritised one of these SNPs, rs2912553, for functional testing. The allelic frequency of rs2912553 is racially-dimorphic, in concordance with the racially differential expression of PCTP. Reporter gene assays confirmed that the single nucleotide change caused by rs2912553 altered the transcriptional potency of the surrounding genomic locus. Electromobility shift assays, luciferase assays, and overexpression studies indicated a role for the megakaryocytic transcription factor GATA1. In summary, we have integrated multi-omic data to identify and functionalise an eQTL. This, along with the previously described relationship between PCTP and PAR4 function, allows us to characterise a genotype- phenotype relationship through the mechanism of gene expression.
0	5	5	CS 	 Computer graphics  	 parallel surface mesh generation; high performance computing; domain decomposition        	This work describes a technique for generating parametric surfaces meshes using parallel computing, with distributed memory processors. This technique can be used in many areas, such as Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality, among others. The input for the algorithm is a set of parametric patches that model the surface of a given object. A structure for spatial partitioning is proposed to decompose the domain in as many subdomains as processes in the parallel system. Each subdomain consists of a set of patches and the division of its load is guided following an estimate. This decomposition attempts to balance the amount of work in all the subdomains. The amount of work, known as load, of any mesh generator is usually given as a function of its output size, i.e., the size of the generated mesh. Therefore, a technique to estimate the size of this mesh, the total load of the domain, is needed beforehand. This work makes use of an analytical average curvature calculated for each patch, which in turn is input data to estimate this load and the decomposition is made from this analytical mean curvature. Once the domain is decomposed, each process generates the mesh on that subdomain or set of patches by a quadtree technique for inner regions, advancing front technique for border regions and is finally applied an improvement to mesh generated. This technique presented good speed-up results, keeping the quality of the mesh comparable to the quality of the serially generated mesh.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 anti-inflammatory; elicitor; Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.; HPLC-ESI-MS/MS; RAPD        	Glycyrrhiza uralensis has acquired significant importance due to its medicinal properties and health function. In this study, the quality of G. uralensis adventitious roots was evaluated in terms of genetic stability, active compounds, and anti-inflammatory activity. Monomorphic banding pattern obtained from the mother plant and tissue cultures of G. uralensis with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers confirmed the genetic stability of adventitious roots. Neoliquiritin (neoisoliquiritin), ononin, liquiritin, and glycyrrhizic acid were identified from G. uralensis adventitious roots on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. This study also revealed that adventitious roots possessed a better anti-inflammatory effect than native roots. To increase the contents of G. uralensis active components, elicitors were used in the adventitious roots culture. The combination of methyl jasmonate and phenylalanine synergistically stimulated the accumulation of glycyrrhetinic acid (0.22 mg/g) and total flavonoid (5.43 mg/g) compared with single treatment. In conclusion, G. uralensis adventitious roots can be an exploitable system for the production of licorice. (C) 2016 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

The dynamic characteristics of JavaScript pose software engineering challenges such as program understanding and security. One important feature of JavaScript is that its objects support flexible mechanisms such as property changes at runtime and prototype-based inheritance, making it difficult to reason about object behavior. We have performed an empirical study on real JavaScript applications to understand the dynamic behavior of JavaScript objects. We present metrics to measure behavior of JavaScript objects during execution (e.g., operations associated with an object, object size, and property type changes). We also investigated the behavioral patterns of observed objects to understand the coding or user interaction practices in JavaScript software. Copyright (c) 2015John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The patients received treatment with oral itraconazole in conjunction with long-pulsed Nd: YAG 1064-nm laser treatment at the nails of the unilateral limb once a week for a total of four times. A total of 84 affected nails were divided into Group A (mild to moderate) and Group B (severe) according to disease severity. Affected nails with the same Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis scores were selected to compare the therapeutic effects of the pure medication treatment group and the combination treatment group with a 24-week follow-up period. Results: In Group A, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 81.0%, 81.0%, and 90.5%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 100%, 95.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. The differences between groups were not significant (8th week: chi(2) = 4.421, P >0.05; 16th week: chi(2) = 2.043, P >0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 0.00, P >0.05). In Group B, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 61.9%, 66.7%, and 52.4%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 95.2%, 90.5%, and 100%, respectively. The differences between groups at the 8th and 24th weeks of follow-up were statistically significant (8th week: chi(2) = 6.929, P < 0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 13.125, P < 0.05). Conclusions: For patients with mild or moderate onychomycosis, we recommended a pure medication treatment or combination treatment with medication and laser. For those patients with severe onychomycosis, we recommended a combination of medication and laser therapy.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 antisocial personality disorder; drug therapy; psychopathy; sociopathy        	What is known and objective Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by deficits in personality and behaviour. Personality deficits are marked by interpersonal and affective facets, including pathological lying, grandiose sense of self-worth, lack of remorse and callousness. Behavioural deficits are defined by lifestyle and antisocial deficits, including impulsivity, parasitic lifestyle and poor behavioural controls. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians with (i) an appreciation of the clinical features of psychopathy, (ii) an understanding of the structural and functional derangements and the genetic and environmental factors which serve as the basis for the development of psychopathy and (iii) a summary of published reports of pharmacological approaches to the management of this disorder. Methods A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed (1966-present) was conducted using the MeSH search terms psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder alone and in combination with the subheading drug therapy. Additional databases included Web of Science (1945-present) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-present) using the text words psychopath and antisocial personality were searched. A search of Amazon books using the search terms psychopathy and sociopathy was also performed. Bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional citations. All data sources in English were considered for inclusion. For background information, broad subject headings were searched for review articles first. Human and animal drug therapy articles were evaluated giving preference to those papers using a controlled trial methodology. Results and Discussion Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of conscience, pathologic lying, manipulative behaviour and often superficial charm. The incidence of psychopathy in the general population is generally considered to be 0 center dot 6-4% with a higher proportion of males to females. Brain imaging studies of psychopaths suggest a smaller and less active amygdala and prefrontal cortex. There also appear to be physiological derangements in psychopathy, including alterations/dysregulation in neurotransmitter homeostasis (dopamine and serotonin), altered endocrine responses (testosterone and cortisol) and altered autonomic responses to emotional stimuli and stressors. Although both genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to the developmental basis of psychopathy, these factors are poorly understood at present. To date, limited studies with pharmacologic interventions in psychopathy are available and there are insufficient trials to determine efficacy. What is new and conclusion Psychopathy is a serious personality disorder with profound negative effects on individuals and society. To design rational therapeutic strategies for this disorder, additional research is needed to discover the specific pathological and pathophysiological basis of psychopathy and to further elucidate the genetic and environmental factors responsible for psychopathic development. There is emerging evidence of phenotypic variants in psychopathy, including successful and unsuccessful types. It is important for clinicians to be cognizant of the psychopathic personality.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 biological mechanism; biomarker; gastric cancer; miRNA; prognosis        	Background and Aim: In our previous study, we demonstrated that four microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-26a, miR-142-3p, miR-148a, and miR-195) that were downregulated in both plasma and tumor tissues were confirmed to be promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer (GC). Methods: We used the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to assess the expression levels of the four miRNAs from paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of GC patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test were applied to predict the correlation between miRNAs and cumulative overall survival (OS) of patients with GC. Besides, we performed in vitro assays including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation, and apoptosis. Results: The median of miRNA expression in paraffin-embedded tissues were used as the cutoff value to classify patients into high or low expression groups. Down-regulation of miR-26a and miR-148a was significantly associated with shorter OS of GC patients either in the test set (miR-26a: P=0.009; miR-148a: P=0.005) or the validation set (miR-26a: P=0.011; miR-148a: P=0.024). When two sets were combined, Cox regression analysis demonstrated that both of miR-26a and miR-148a were independent prognostic factors for predicting OS of patients with GC (miR-26a: HR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.94; miR-148a: HR=0.73, 95% CI=0.58-0.91). Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-26 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation, and induced apoptosis of MGC-803 cells compared with negative control groups (P<0.05). Conclusion: These findings supported miR-26a and miR-148a could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers for GC.
3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 Two strokes; CFD; Cooling efficiency        	On the basis of the operating cooling fluid, internal combustion engine cooling systems can be classified in two macro areas: air-cooling system and liquid-cooling system. In four-stroke engines, liquid-cooling system is generally preferred to the air-cooling system because of its efficiency in the engine heat dissipation. However, thanks to its simplicity, today the engine air-cooling system is still widely used in the engine market, especially on two-stroke engine applications like small motorbike, light aircraft, and handheld products. To assure the necessary heat waste in air-cooled engines, the key point is the optimization of the air flow over the cylinder external surface. Air flow separation from cylinder external surface can result in high temperature gradients inside the cylinder volume causing destructive heat problem for the engine. It can be avoided only by a fine optimization of the cylinder fin design placed externally to the cylinder surface. To fulfil this need, the definition of specific methodology to evaluate the air-cooling effect on the engine is mandatory. In the present paper, the authors present a 3D-CFD simulation methodology designed to perform a detailed evaluation of two-stroke air-cooled engines. The methodology was applied on two different engines equipping handheld brush-cutter machines. The optimization of the air-cooling system of such a machine is a very challenging task because the machine design must be very compact forcing all the engine parts to remain quite close each other. The simulation results are compared to experimental evidences in order to verify the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

STIs have been associated with increased risk of transmission and acquisition of HIV. Among HIV-infected persons, treatment failures and high recurrence rates of some STIs are more common. Despite the recognized importance of prevention and discussion of sexual health, rates of screening for STIs are suboptimal. Moreover, rates of STIs such as syphilis continue to increase particularly in men who have sex with men (MSM). This review focuses on the most common STIs seen among HIV-infected individuals and recommendations for screening and prevention.
5	28	100	Medical 	 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis  	 diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide; biological control; quality control; simulator        	BACKGROUND: The 2005 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines for single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D-LCO, recommend a weekly 1 biological control test and/or D-LCO simulator to detect instrument error drift. Very little has been published regarding the results of such a quality assurance program. Our aim was to analyze the long-term stability of a portable D-LCO instrument. METHODS: We used a new EasyOne Pro system and checked its accuracy using a D-LCO simulator with 2 reference gases (concentration A: carbon monoxide [CO] = 0.1% and helium = 6.52%; concentration B: CO = 0.08% and helium = 7.21 %) during the first 3 y of use in our large clinical laboratory. To detect instrument drift, a healthy woman (MSC), age 43 y old at baseline, tested herself every week during this period of time. RESULTS: More than 6,000 spirometry and 5,000 D-LCO maneuvers were done using this instrument for patients during these 3 y. There were no failures in the daily volume and flow checks or the CO and helium calibration checks performed automatically by the instrument. The differences between the simulator D-LCO and the measured D-LCO were -0.91 +/- 1.33 mL/min/mm Hg and -0.61 +/- 1.45 mL/min/mm Hg for concentration A and concentration B, respectively. The results of the 110 biological control tests were: mean 30.8 +/- 1.7 mL/min/mm Hg (95% CI 30.5-31.1), coefficient of variation of 5.4% in D-LCO, and repeatability of 2.5 mL/min/mm Hg. Only 4 measurements were outside +/- 3 mL/min/mm Hg (3.6%). Her mean alveolar volume was 4.2 +/- 0.25 L with coefficient of variation of 6.2%; her inspired volume was 3.05 +/- 0.14 L, and coefficient of variation = 4.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of D-LCO were stable over the 3-y period without any need for manual recalibration of the instrument. The biological control was as good as the D-LCO simulator to evaluate this kind of device in a long-term laboratory quality control program.

Developing the low-FODMAP diet required not only extensive food composition data but also the establishment of ""cutoff values"" to classify foods as low-FODMAP. These cutoff values relate to each particular FODMAP present in a food, including oligosaccharides (fructans and galactooligosaccharides), sugar polyols (mannitol and sorbitol), lactose, and fructose in excess of glucose. Cutoff values were derived by considering the FODMAP levels in typical serving sizes of foods that commonly trigger symptoms in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome, as well as foods that were generally well tolerated. The reliability of these FODMAP cutoff values has been tested in a number of dietary studies. The development of the techniques to quantify the FODMAP content of foods has greatly advanced our understanding of food composition. FODMAP composition is affected by food processing techniques and ingredient selection. In the USA, the use of high-fructose corn syrups may contribute to the higher FODMAP levels detected (via excess fructose) in some processed foods. Because food processing techniques and ingredients can vary between countries, more comprehensive food composition data are needed for this diet to be more easily implemented internationally."
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 Specific locus test; Linear dose response; LNT; Dose-rate; Hormesis        	This paper reveals that nearly 25 years after the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) I Committee (1972) used Russell's dose-rate data to support the adoption of the linear-no-threshold (LNT) dose response model for genetic and cancer risk assessment, Russell acknowledged a significant under-reporting of the mutation rate of the historical control group. This error, which was unknown to BEIR I, had profound implications, leading it to incorrectly adopt the LNT model, which was a decision that profoundly changed the course of risk assessment for radiation and chemicals to the present.

TRX is induced by various oxidative stress factors, including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia reperfusion and anticancer agents, and are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. We have demonstrated that systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of TRX is effective in a wide variety of in vivo inflammatory disease models, such as viral pneumonia, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric injury, and dermatitis. Our recent studies indicate that topically applied TRX prevents skin inflammation via the inhibition of local formation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These indicate that the activation of inflammasome in skin and mucosa may be regulated by TRX. These suggest that application of TRX may be useful for the treatment of various skin and mucosal inflammatory disorders. Based on these results, we are conducting clinical studies to develop human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhTRX) pharmaceuticals. We have also developed substances that increase the expression of TRX in the body (TRX-inducing substances) in vegetables and other plant ingredients, and we are also developing skin-care products and functional foods that take advantage of the anti-inflammation and anti-allergic action of TRX.

5	5	77	Medical 	 Asthma  	 Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome; Graft-versus-host disease; Nuclear factor-kB pathway; Chemokines; Lymphocyte trafficking        	"Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious inflammatory disorder of the lungs that occurs most often after fully myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). IPS can be severe and is associated with high 1-year mortality rates despite existing therapies. The canonical nuclear factor (NF) id3 signaling pathway has previously been linked to several inflammatory disorders of the lung, including asthma and lung allograft rejection. It has never been specifically targeted as a novel IPS treatment approach, however. Here, we report that the 1 kappa B kinase 2 (IKK2) antagonist BAY 65-5811 or ""compound A,"" a highly potent and specific inhibitor of the NF-kappa B pathway, was able to improve median survival times and recipient oxygenation in a well-described mouse model of IPS. Compound A impaired the production of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 within the host lung after transplantation. This resulted in significantly lower numbers of donor lung infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and reduced pulmonary inflammatory cytokine production after allograft. Compound A's beneficial effects appeared to be specific for limiting pulmonary injury, as the drug was unable to improve outcomes in a B6 into B6D2 haplotype-matched murine HSCT model in which recipient mice succumb to lethal acute graft-versus-host disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Collectively, our data suggest that the targeting of the canonical NF-kappa B pathway with a small molecule IKK2 antagonist may represent an effective and novel therapy for the specific management of acute lung injury that can occur after allogeneic HSCT.

MethodsProspective data were collected on BTX naive patients with NDO or IDO who were intolerant or refractory to oral medications. Patients were treated with 100-300U of BTX via one to three injection sites. Patients completed the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) prior to and after treatment. The primary endpoint was defined as ICIQ-SF score improvement of >5 points. Secondary endpoints included subjective success, complete continence, quality of life score, post void residual (PVR), duration of effect and adverse events. ResultsFourty-five patients (22 IDO, 23 NDO) were included. ICIQ-SF score improvement of >5 points was achieved in 73% (IDO 55%, NDO 91%) and the subjective success rate was 69% (50% IDO, 87% NDO). 52% of NDO patients attained complete continence. PVR increased by a mean of 32 and 156ml in the IDO and NDO groups. Hematuria occurred in 6.7% and symptomatic urinary tract infection occurred in 11.1%. No systemic BTX adverse events occurred. Mean duration of effect was 31 weeks. ConclusionsOur technique for administering BTX via one to three intradetrusor injection sites has similar clinical efficacy and rates of adverse events compared to the established technique for treating patients with IDO and NDO.

1	10	26	ECE 	 Electric motor  	 Clutchless multimode parallel hybrid electric vehicle (CMP-HEV); design optimization; dynamic programming (DP); feasibility assessment; parallel HEV; pareto front        	The fuel economy (FE) of the parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) suffers due to significant energy losses from the wet clutches of the automatic transmission and limited engine operations. To overcome these limitations, a novel clutchless multimode parallel HEV (CMP-HEV) was proposed previously, but its operational feasibility was not proven. In this study, we propose a systematic methodology that can assess the feasibility of the CMP-HEV and efficiently optimize FE and acceleration performance of the design, simultaneously. Using the dynamic models, we assess the feasibility over the entire design spaces under two conditions: full acceleration (for drivability) and moderate acceleration (for fuel efficiency). An instantaneous optimization method is used to rapidly evaluate the full acceleration performance, and the designs with poor acceleration are considered infeasible. For the fuel efficiency, the feasibility is determined by the violation of electric motor constraints under the assumption of efficient engine operations. The feasible design sets from the assessment are used for the design optimization. Dynamic programming is applied over only the feasible design space, and the Pareto front is obtained to show the tradeoff between FE and acceleration performance. The selected final design is found superior to a comparable parallel HEV in both FE and acceleration performance perspectives.
0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 Poisson Delaunay triangulation; Point location; Routing; Stretch factor        	Planar graph navigation is an important problem with significant implications to both point location in geometric data structures and routing in networks. However, whilst a number of algorithms and existence proofs have been proposed, very little analysis is available for the properties of the paths generated and the computational resources required to generate them under a random distribution hypothesis for the input. In this paper we analyse a new deterministic planar navigation algorithm with constant spanning ratio (w.r.t the Euclidean distance) which follows vertex adjacencies in the Delaunay triangulation. We call this strategy cone walk. We prove that given n uniform points in a smooth convex domain of unit area, and for any start point z and query point q; cone walk applied to z and q will access at most O(vertical bar zq vertical bar root n + log(7) n) sites with complexity O(vertical bar zq vertical bar root n log log n + log(7) n) with probability tending to 1 as n goes to infinity. We additionally show that in this model, cone walk is (log(3+xi) n)-memoryless with high probability for any pair of start and query point in the domain, for any positive xi. We take special care throughout to ensure our bounds are valid even when the query points are arbitrarily close to the border. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
3	3	55	MAE 	 Machine design  	 Electric machines; Permanent magnet machines; Temperature measurement; Temperature sensors; Thermal analysis; Wireless communication        	The overall performance of an electric machine is closely linked to the thermal design of the machine and there is a trend to include more thermal analysis into the machine design procedure in academic literature. Thus, there is also a motivation to prototype experimental machines for accurate validations of the thermal analysis. One of the challenges is to measure rotor temperatures online while the machine is in operation. This paper presents some of the experience from designing an online temperature monitoring system for an experimental IPMSM. In total, 32 sensors was successfully placed inside the 3.4 liter volume of the small IPMSM and temperature data was transmitted from the rotor in the end of the shaft, using infrared light. It was found that the online temperature monitoring system was very reliable. Both the used analog and digital sensors exhibit equal results and EMI immunity, when placed inside the electromagnetically noisy environment inside the machine.
6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 EGFR    NeuGcGM3; Co-expression; Pulmonary metastasis; Combination therapy       	Interaction between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling with GM3 ganglioside expression has been previously described. However, little is known about EGFR and NeuGcGM3 co-expression in cancer patients and their therapeutic implications. In this paper, we evaluate the co-expression of EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside in tumors from 92 patients and in two spontaneous lung metastasis models of mice (Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL-D122) in C57BL/6 and mammary carcinoma (4T1) in BALB/c). As results, co-expression of EGFR and NeuGcGM3 ganglioside was frequently observed in 63 of 92 patients (68 %), independently of histological subtype. Moreover, EGFR is co-expressed with NeuGcGM3 ganglioside in the metastasis of 3LL-D122 and 4T1 murine models. Such dual expression appears to be therapeutically relevant, since combined therapy with mAbs against these two molecules synergistically increase the survival of mice treated. Overall, our results suggest that NeuGcGM3 and EGFR may coordinately contribute to the tumor cell biology and that therapeutic combinations against these two targets might be a valid strategy to explore.

Three catalogues for three different structures with each structure realizing 17 oscillator circuits are presented. Some of the new circuits are enjoying the attractive features of using grounded capacitors and/or independent/orthogonal tuning for the frequency and condition of oscillation. However, the classification of independent/orthogonal tuning may be misleading as it is based on using the Barkhausen criterion. Therefore, it is shown that using the roots of the characteristic equation of a specific oscillator circuit; while not leading to accurate results, may avoid any misleading conclusion regarding the orthogonal tuning of the frequency and condition of oscillation. Experimental results using the AD844 CFOA are included.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 contractors; readiness; model; assessment; sustainable construction        	While the sustainability concept has gained recognition in Indonesia, contractors have been slowly implementing the principles in construction projects. An assessment model was developed as a tool to identify the baseline conditions of contractors' readiness, i.e. awareness, willingness, and capacity towards sustainability practices. The model involves parameters and indicators derived from green building and green contractor concepts, and sustainable construction best practices. The scoring system for these parameters and indicators was set up through discussions with experts using the Delphi method facilitated by the Ministry of Public Works. Trial surveys were conducted to refine the model. A preliminary portrayal of existing conditions in Indonesia was assessed using the proposed readiness assessment model. This limited survey indicated that while large contractors are fully aware and willing, they have been only partly implementing sustainability practices. Because the process of developing the model had involved experts and champions of the industry/stakeholders, and was also led by the government/Ministry of Public Works, the proposed assessment model should be inherently acceptable for industry-wide application.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Phosphorus; Nitrogen; No-till; Rainfall simulation        	Liquid manure applied in agricultural lands improves soil quality. However, incorrect management of manure may cause environmental problems due to sediments and nutrients losses associated to runoff. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the time effect of post-liquid dairy manure (LDM) application on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses; (ii) compare the effect of conventional tillage and no-till systems on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses after LDM application. A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on intact soil blocks collected from fields that had been under conventional tillage and no-till systems. Rainfall was applied 24 h or 7 days after LDM application. Conventional tillage without manure application resulted on higher runoff, sediment and nutrient losses (mainly the particulate fraction) than no-till without manure. The greatest runoff, sediment and nutrients losses occurred in the treatments where simulated rainfall was performed 24 h after LDM application independent of the tillage system. An interval of 7 days between manure application and the rainfall event reduced sediment, particulate P, and particulate N losses in both conventional and no-till systems. In practical terms, we would recommend a minimum of 7 days between LDM application and rainfall-runoff event to provide agronomic benefits minimizing the potential risk of water pollution.

1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM); digital control; induction heating (IH); power control; series resonant inverter        	The traditional power control schemes for induction heating device mainly focus on the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and the pulse density modulation. But they cannot solve the problems of power control, efficiency, and load-adaption well. This paper presents and analyzes the asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM) control scheme used in the full-bridge series resonant inverter. With the proposed AFM control technique, the output power is controlled by two variables: the operation frequency and the division factor. Better efficiency performance can be achieved in the medium and low output power range when compared with PFM. The principles as well as the zero-voltage switching condition of the AFM are explained and the power losses of switches are analyzed. A control algorithm that schedules the three control modes of AFM is experimentally verified with a digital signal processor based induction heating prototype. The load-adaption, noise and thermal distribution problem of switches are also analyzed.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 ADS; Integrated spallation target; Thermal-hydraulics analysis; Geometry modification        	As a key component in Accelerator Driven System (ADS), the spallation target is exposed to high irradiation intensity radiation, and a larger amount of heat is deposited on it. Therefore, the cooling of the target is a challenging task in the target design. Integrated target module with a solid beam window, and cooled by reactor primary coolant is a good contender for ADS system. The numerical analysis of two target modules was performed by using finite element code to assess the target cooling capacity. It was found that with uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet could improve the heat transfer effectively. But with non-uniform inlet velocity, the geometry modification of the inlet had little effect on cooling capacity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
4	2	63	Civil 	 Remote Sensing  	 Postseismic geo-hazard; postseismic vegetation recovery; time series of remote sensing images; vegetation recovery classifications        	Mountainous vegetation recovery after major earthquakes has important implications for preventing postseismic soil erosion and geo-hazards. However, regional recovery processes of the postseismic vegetation and its spatial patterns have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we examined the vegetation recovery processes following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms. 7.8) using 16-day intervalMODIS normalized difference vegetation index time series from 2000 to 2014. The Savitzky-Golay filter and cross-correlogram spectral matching were used to eliminate the influences of cloud and intraannual phenology. Change vector analysis was applied to measure the postseismic vegetation recovery conditions for each year. We find that the heavily affected vegetation areas are mainly located along the southern part of the earthquake surface rupture. Additionally, five major affected vegetation types have been identified: shrubland, grassland, broadleaf/mixed, needleleaf, and plantation. Shrubland represents the largest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area, whereas plantation comprises the smallest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area. Further analysis indicates that the changing trend of postseismic vegetation conditions in the first six years can be grouped into three classes: recovering, fluctuating, and deteriorating. Recovering and fluctuating classes cover 59% and 37% of the heavily affected areas, respectively, and are the two dominant postseismic vegetation classes. In contrast, the deteriorating recovery class covers just 4% of the affected areas. The recovering vegetation is primarily located around the epicenter, and most of the fluctuating classes is located to the northeast of the epicenter. These results demonstrate that the Wenchuan earthquake has long-term and important influences on mountain vegetation, andmore attention should be given to the locations of deteriorating and fluctuating vegetation following mountain disasters.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 Aflatoxin B-1; prenatal exposure; mutagenesis; DNA adducts        	It has become axiomatic that critical windows of susceptibility to genotoxins exist and that genetic damage in utero may be a trigger for later life cancers. Data supporting this critical window hypothesis are remarkably few. This study provides a quantitative bridge between DNA damage by the liver carcinogen aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) during prenatal development and the risk of later life genetic disease. AFB(1) was given to pregnant C57BL/6J mice, carrying F-1 gestation day 14 (GD14) embryos of the B6C3F1 genotype. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) using aflatoxin-N-15(5)-guanine adduct standards afforded measurement of the AFB(1)-N-7-Gua and AFB(1)-FAPY adducts 6-hr post dosing in liver DNA of mothers and embryos. A parallel cohort gave birth and the livers of the F-1 were analyzed for mutations in the gpt gene at 3 and 10 weeks of age. The data revealed mutational spectra dominated by G:C to T:A mutations in both the mother and offspring that are characteristic of AFB(1) and distinct from background. It was shown that adducts in GD14 embryos were 20-fold more potent inducers of mutagenesis than adducts in parallel-dosed adults. This sensitivity enhancement correlated with Ki67 staining of the liver, reflecting the proliferative potential of the tissue. Taken together, these data provide insight into the relative genetic risks of prenatal and adult exposures to AFB(1). Early life exposure, especially during the embryonic period, is strikingly more mutagenic than treatment later in life. Moreover the data provide a baseline against which risk prevention strategies can be evaluated. What's New? Genetic damage in utero can pave the way for cancer later in life. Why are younger animals more susceptible to carcinogens than adults? In this paper, the authors quantify this effect for the first time. They exposed fetal mice to aflatoxin and compared the rates of cancer-causing mutations with adult mice exposed to the same dose of aflatoxin. The DNA adducts created were 20-fold more likely to cause mutations in liver cells in the young mice than in the adults. Not surprisingly, they observed that fetal liver cells were dividing much faster than adult liver cells, providing evidence for the view that rapid cell division creates this youthful susceptibility to carcinogens.

High-throughput genome sequencing and bioinformatics are enhancing our ability to investigate and control outbreaks, detect emerging infectious diseases, develop vaccines, and combat antimicrobial resistance, all with increased accuracy, timeliness, and efficiency. The Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) initiative has allowed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to provide leadership and coordination in integrating new technologies into routine practice throughout the U.S. public health laboratory system. Collaboration and partnerships are the key to navigating this transition and to leveraging the next generation of methods and tools most effectively for public health.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 Surgery; Surgical novices; Stress; Stress management training; Mental skills; Mental skills training; Mental training; Performance enhancement        	Background: Stress has been shown to negatively impact surgical performance, and surgical novices are particularly susceptible to its effects. Mental skills are psychological strategies designed to enhance performance and reduce the impact of stress to consistently facilitate the ideal mental conditions that enable performers to perform their best. Mental skills have been used routinely in other high-stress domains (e.g., with Navy SEALs, military pilots, elite athletes, and so forth) to facilitate optimal performance in challenging situations. We have developed a novel mental skills curriculum (MSC) to aid surgical trainees in optimizing their performance under stressful conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of this MSC in reducing novices' stress. Methods: The MSC was implemented with a convenience sample of surgical novices over 8 wk. Two stress tests were administered before and after completion of the MSC to assess its effectiveness in reducing trainee stress. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a validated method of measuring participants' stress responses; it was implemented by giving participants 10 min to prepare for an impromptu presentation and 5 min to present it in front of a medical education expert who would be assessing them. The O'Connor Tweezer Dexterity Test (OTDT) is a test of fine motor dexterity; participants competed against each other in small groups who would complete the test the fastest. Such competition has been shown to cause acute stress in performers. To assess stress, heart rate (HR), perceived stress (STAI-6), and perceived workload (NASA-TLX) were completed during all testing sessions. Results: Nine novices (age 23 +/- 7 y, 55% women) completed the MSC. HR increased significantly from resting to performance during the TSST and from early during competition (at 2 min and 30s of elapsed time) to immediately after completing the task. However, participants perceived less stress during and immediately after the TSST and OTDT tests (P < 0.05) after completion of the MSC. In addition, they reported significantly less workload during the second OTDT administration (P < 0.05) and showed a trend toward faster completion of this test. Conclusions: The novel MSC was effective at reducing surgical novices' perceived stress and workload during two comprehensive stress tests. Although not statistically significant, participant's enhanced performance during the OTDT is encouraging. This curriculum may be valuable to help inexperienced learners reduce stress in a variety of situations related to learning and performing surgical skills. Additional research using a larger sample size is currently underway to validate the effectiveness of this curriculum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The surface PM machine, spoke PM machine and interior PM machine were compared in terms of performances and capabilities at high speed operation. Finite element analysis was used for accurate performances prediction. For the sake of accuracy, the amount and type of PM and the stator structure are maintained the same in the design process for all three machines.
5	33	105	Medical 	 Medicare  	 glaucoma; expenditures; telemedicine; out-of-pocket        	Purpose:Nonmedical out-of-pocket cost to both patients and their companions of office visits for routine glaucoma care has not been extensively studied in the United States. We evaluate potential key predictors of patient expenditures that are critical to assessing the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma health care delivery.Materials and Methods:In total, 300 patients responded to the survey in 3 clinics in 2 clinical practice settings. Main outcome measures included both average visit and yearly expenditures.Results:Of the 300 patients, the majority were female (n=187, 62.3%) and African American (n=171, 57.0%). The median age was 66 years. The median [range; mean (SD)] expenditure per patient visit was $22.10 ($11.1, $42.9; $44.1 (72.8)). Patients with companions paid $38.77 more in average visit expenditure (: 0.87, P<0.001). The average visit expenditure for retired patients was $17.37 less when compared with nonretired patients (: -0.4, P=0.004). Patients living in a rural or suburban area paid $43.91 and $14.13 more per visit, respectively (: 0.73, P=0.0004; : 0.31, P=0.03), compared with patients living in an urban area. Patients with noncommercial insurance paid $24.01 less in average visit expenditure (: -0.66, P=0.0008). The median yearly patient expenditure was $96.70 [$44.6, $222.7; $210.4 (333.9)]. Patients with companions paid $192.37 more in yearly expenditure (: 0.9, P<0.001) than those without companions, whereas retired patients paid $80.83 less in yearly expenditure (: -0.39, P=0.03) than nonretirees. Patients with noncommercial insurance paid $109.34 less in yearly expenditure (: -0.63, P=0.01).Conclusions:Although a small part of the total cost of glaucoma care, nonmedical out-of-pocket costs constitute a substantial noncovered medical expense to most patients in the United States. Patients who are employed, come with companions, live in nonurban areas, or are on Medicare have greater expenditures.
5	17	89	Medical 	 Digestive Health  	 Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy; NDF level; Weaning age; Fattening mortality; Caecum microbiota; Rabbits        	An experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary fibre content and weaning age oil Clostridium perfringens proliferation in the caecum and fattening mortality in growing rabbits farmed in a facility having Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy. The experiment consisted in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two weaning ages (28 days vs. 42 days) and two levels of dietary neutral detergent fibre assayed with a heat stable amylase and expressed exclusive of residual ash (aNDFom; 330g/kg vs. 425g/kg). Controls were made during two consecutive experimental periods that differed in hygienic environmental conditions by modifying the intensity of cleaning and disinfection in the farm previous to the trial. An interaction (P<0.001) was detected among the independent variables studied on Cl. perfringens enumeration in the caecal contents, as minimal values for this trait were obtained in non-medicated animals reared in a clean environment, and especially when they were weaned at a later age and fed the diet with the lower fibre content. The treatments studied also led to a variation in fattening mortality(from 4.7% to 34.0%), which was highly and positively-correlated (P<0.001) to the average Cl. perfringens caecal counts in each combination of treatments. The results of the current study indicate that high Counts of Cl. perfringens in the caecum can be used as an indicator of Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy, and suggest that strategies designed to control its proliferation in the caecum might help to limit fattening mortality in rabbit fed diets not-medicated with antibiotics.

5	9	81	Medical 	 Skin Care  	 Facial Dermatoses; Skin care; Skin pigmentation        	BACKGROUND: Peri-orbital dark circles are a cosmetic concern worldwide, and have been attributed to hyperpigmentation from allergy or atopic dermatitis, blood stasis, structural shadowing effects, and a thin epidermis/dermis under the eye. It is of interest to better understand lifestyle and demographic risk factors and the relative impact of melanin, blood and epidermal/dermal factors on the severity of Peri-orbital dark circles. OBJECTIVE: To compare by non-invasive imaging the impact of biological factors to a visual grading scale for Peri-orbital dark circles, and test the correlation of various demographic factors with Peri-orbital dark circles. METHODS: Subjects completed a lifestyle and health survey, and Peri-orbital dark circles severity was evaluated using standardized photographs. Hyperspectral image analysis was used to assess the contributions of melanin, blood volume, degree of blood oxygen saturation, and dermal scattering. RESULTS: Family history was the most significant risk factor for Peri-orbital dark circles. The average age of onset was 24 years, and earlier onset correlated with higher severity scores. Asthma was significantly associated with Peri-orbital dark circles scores, but self-reported allergy was not. In this study, sleep was not correlated with Peri-orbital dark circles scores. Hyperspectral imaging indicated that melanin was the dominant correlate for Peri-orbital dark circles severity, while oxygen saturation was secondary. The difference between under-eye and cheek measurements for Delta L* and Delta E* were the most significant instrumental parameters correlated with visual assessment of Peri-orbital dark circles severity. CONCLUSION: Although typically associated with lack of sleep, risk of Peri-orbital dark circles is primarily hereditary. The main factors contributing to the appearance of Peri-orbital dark circles are melanin and (deoxygenated) blood.
2	14	47	Psychology  	 Child abuse  	 children's testimonies; police interviews; Republic of Cyprus; tourist season; videotaped testimonies        	Familiarising researchers and practitioners with different countries' policies for police interviews with children contributes to an exchange of knowledge and strengthens global approaches against child abuse. We start by describing the system of videotaped testimonies in Cyprus during the first 10years of this system's implementation. We then continue on to the effects of tourism on police interviews with children. Police forces in destinations with high tourist numbers need to comprehend how tourist seasons could influence police interviews with children. No studies investigated whether children of tourists testified in police departments during their holidays. We explored how tourist seasons affected the number of testimonies obtained by Cyprus police forces, taking into account the presence of non-Cypriot and non-native speaking children, the number of testimonies taken in languages other than Greek, and the presence of translators during the interviews. We analysed the national sample of police interviews with children for a period of a decade using official police records and copies of transcripts of children's testimonies. As expected, the results revealed no significant differences in police interviews with children during tourist seasons but show a slight increase in the number of interviews with non-Cypriot children during tourist seasons.

Shuan-Tong-Ling is a formula used to treat brain diseases including ischemic stroke, migraine, and vascular dementia. Shuan-Tong-Ling attenuated H2O2-induced oxidative stress in rat microvascular endothelial cells. However, the potential mechanism involved in these effects is poorly understood. Rats were intragastrically treated with 5.7 or 17.2 mL/kg Shuan-Tong-Ling for 7 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced. The results indicated Shuan-Tong-Ling had a cerebral protective effect by reducing infarct volume and increasing neurological scores. Shuan-Tong-Ling also decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta levels in the hippocampus on the ischemic side. In addition, Shuan-Tong-Ling upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of acetylated-protein 53 and Bax. Injection of 5 mg/kg silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) inhibitor EX527 into the subarachnoid space once every 2 days, four times, reversed the above changes. These results demonstrate that Shuan-Tong-Ling might benefit cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation and apoptosis through activation of the SIRT1 signaling pathway.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Software-defined networking; network functions virtualization; network security; smart factory        	This paper describes a framework for software-based networking in smart factories (SF) that enables them to easily adapt the communication network to changing requirements. Similar to cloud-based systems, such SFs could be seen as production clusters that could be rented and configured as needed. The SF network utilizes software-defined networking (SDN) combined with network functions virtualization (NFV) in order to achieve the required flexibility. This paper presents and discusses our vision of a network architecture for SFs based on SDN and network virtualization in order to support smart services especially for Industrie 4.0. Despite the fact that the technology is nowadays not yet ready for deployment in today's manufacturing networks, we present a framework for software-defined factory networks and discuss possible challenges and benefits.
6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 EPIC-Oxford; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; vegan; vegetarian        	Background: Human metabolism is influenced by dietary factors and lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors; thus, men who exclude some or all animal products from their diet might have different metabolic profiles than meat eaters. Objective: We aimed to investigate differences in concentrations of 118 circulating metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, hexose, and sphingolipids related to lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism between male meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans from the Oxford arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Design: In this cross-sectional study, concentrations of metabolites were measured by mass spectrometry in plasma from 379 men categorized according to their diet group. Differences in mean metabolite concentrations across diet groups were tested by using ANOVA, and a false discovery rate-controlling procedure was used to account for multiple testing. Principal component analysis was used to investigate patterns in metabolic profiles. Results: Concentrations of 79% of metabolites differed significantly by diet group. In the vast majority of these cases, vegans had the lowest concentration, whereas meat eaters most often had the highest concentrations of the acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, and fish eaters or vegetarians most often had the highest concentrations of the amino acids and a biogenic amine. A clear separation between patterns in the metabolic profiles of the 4 diet groups was seen, with vegans being noticeably different from the other groups because of lower concentrations of some glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Conclusions: Metabolic profiles in plasma could effectively differentiate between men from different habitual diet groups, especially vegan men compared with men who consume animal products. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by the lower concentrations of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in vegans.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 System identification; Hybrid systems; Piecewise affine systems; Fuzzy PCA; guided k; means clustering; Outlier detection        	Hybrid systems are a class of dynamical systems whose behaviors are based on the interaction between discrete and continuous dynamical behaviors. Since a general method for the analysis of hybrid systems is not available, some researchers have focused on specific types of hybrid systems. Piecewise affine (PWA) systems are one of the subsets of hybrid systems. The identification of PWA systems includes the estimation of the parameters of affine subsystems and the coefficients of the hyperplanes defining the partition of the state-input domain. In this paper, we have proposed a PWA identification approach based on a modified clustering technique. By using a fuzzy PCA-guided robust k-means clustering algorithm along with neighborhood outlier detection, the two main drawbacks of the well-known clustering algorithms, i.e., the poor initialization and the presence of outliers, are eliminated. Furthermore, this modified clustering technique enables us to determine the number of subsystems without any prior knowledge about system. In addition, applying the structure of the state-input domain, that is, considering the time sequence of input-output pairs, provides a more efficient clustering algorithm, which is the other novelty of this work. Finally, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated by parameter identification of an IGV servo actuator. Simulation together with experiment analysis has proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 Nurse residency programs; Pediatric units; Children's hospitals        	Purpose This paper presents the results of a national survey of pediatric nurse residency programs (NRP). Design and Methods: The Pediatric Nursing Certification Board (PNCB) database was used to identify 316 hospitals with pediatric units, including children's hospitals and community hospitals with pediatric services. The Residency Task Force of the Institute of Pediatric Nursing (IPN) developed the survey, Exploring Pediatric Nurse Residency Programs. Survey items addressed structure, content, outcomes, benefits and challenges of NRPs, including a comparison with orientation programs and use of preceptors. Results: Of the 316 hospitals contacted, 65 provided usable information and 45 reported having an NRP. Most (94%) of the hospitals have an orientation program, and 70% had an NRP. The NRPs were typically internally developed (60%) and a year in length (46.5%). Most common content (>80%) included critical thinking, stress management, small group support, professional role transition, pediatric resuscitation, and evidence based practice. Evaluation of the NRPs included measures of satisfaction, turnover rates, and standardized measures, primarily the Casey-Fink Graduate Nurse Experience Survey (48.7%). Challenges include obtaining financial support from the organization, developing content relevant across units, providing time away from clinical units, and maintaining preceptors. Benefits noted included development of professional role confidence and peer support networks, increased safe nursing practices, and a decrease in nursing turnover. Conclusions and Practice Implications: In the ongoing development of NRPs in children's hospitals, issues such as appropriate content, optimal length, standardization across settings, impact on nurse retention, safe practice and patient outcomes all need to be addressed.

6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 primary antibody deficiency; inflammatory bowel disease; respiratory infections; children        	Introduction: Respiratory tract infections constitute the most frequent manifestation of X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). There are not many papers elucidating gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in such patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of gastrointestinal disorders and IBD compared to respiratory tract infections in XLA individuals. Material and methods: Of 1563 patients with primary immunodeficiencies diagnosed in the Department of Immunology, the Children's Memorial Health Institute (CMHI), 66 boys had a provisional diagnosis of agammaglobulinemia. Forty-four subjects fulfilled definitive ESID (European Society for Immunodeficiencies) diagnostic criteria of XLA. A retrospective analysis of medical history of XLA patients was undertaken. Results: Recurrent respiratory tract infections, particularly bronchitis (73%) and pneumonia (59%), were the most common symptoms of XLA. The GI disorders constituted the next main manifestation (63.6%), followed by upper respiratory tract infections. Twenty-six of 28 XLA patients with GI disorders complained of diarrhea, which was resolved generally after immunoglobulin therapy introduction. Single but prolonged episodes of Campylobacter jejuni diarrhea were reported in two individuals. Inflammatory bowel disease of mild to moderate activity was diagnosed in 1 patient, and local enteritis of mild activity in another one. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal disorders were one of the main manifestations of XLA, reported almost as often as lower respiratory tract infections. The most common GI symptom was diarrhea, which usually resolved after immunoglobulin therapy was started. Infections caused by Giardia lamblia were reported occasionally. Inflammatory bowel disease was diagnosed quite exceptionally, which presumably may be connected with normal T cell immunity.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 Complementary hydro-photovoltaic; operation; Photovoltaic integration; Optimal capacity; Water resources allocation        	The high variability of solar energy makes utility-scale photovoltaic power generation confront huge challenges to penetrate into power system. In this paper, the complementary hydro-photovoltaic operation is explored, aiming at improving the power quality of photovoltaic and promoting the integration of photovoltaic into the system. First, solar-rich and hydro-rich regions across the world are revealed, which are suitable for implementing the complementary hydro-photovoltaid operation. Then, three practical scenarios of the novel operation mode are proposed for better satisfying different types of load demand. Moreover, a method for optimal sizing of a photovoltaic plant integrated into a hydropower plant is developed by maximizing the net revenue during lifetime. Longyangxia complementary hydro photovoltaic project, the current world's largest hydro-photovoltaic power plant, is selected as a case study and its optimal photovoltaic capacities of different scenarios are calculated. Results indicate that hydropower installed capacity and annual solar curtailment rate play crucial roles in the size optimization of a photovoltaic plant and complementary hydro-photovoltaic operation exerts little adverse effect upon the water resources allocation of Longyangxia reservoir. The novel operation mode not only improves the penetration of utility-scale photovoltaic power generation but also can provide a valuable reference for the large-scale utilization of other kinds of renewable energy worldwide.

Many short-term studies have been performed, but little is known about long-term effects. Therefore, this study described over 6 years (1) mortality, retention and abstinence rates and (2) changes in concomitant drug use and somatic and mental health. Methods: A prevalence sample of n = 2,694 maintenance patients, recruited from a nationally representative sample of n = 223 substitution doctors, was evaluated in a 6-year prospective-longitudinal naturalistic study. At 72 months, n = 1,624 patients were assessed for outcome; 1,147 had full outcome data, 346 primary outcome data and 131 had died; 660 individuals were lost to follow-up. Results: The 6-year retention rate was 76.6%; the average mortality rate was 1.1%. During follow-up, 9.4% of patients became ""abstinent"" and 1.9% were referred for drug-free addiction treatment. Concomitant drug use decreased and somatic health status and social parameters improved. Conclusions: The study provides further evidence for the efficacy and safety of maintenance treatment with opioid agonists. In the long term, the number of opioid-free patients is low and most patients are more or less continuously under opioid maintenance therapy. Further implications are discussed. (C) 2017 S.

0	5	5	CS 	 Computer graphics  	 virtual reality technology; virtual reappearance; ancient cavern protection; Cuiguangyan        	Virtual reality technology is a kind of cross-integration computer technology which is developed on the basis of multiple disciplines, such as computer graphics, sensor technology and computer simulation display. According to the very few applications of the virtual reality technology in a present ancient cavern, an ancient cavern protection scheme based on virtual reality technology is proposed. This paper takes Cuiguangyan ancient caverns, which is an important part of Longyou Grottoes, as an example to virtually reappear the damaged area of Cuiguangyan ancient caverns and the spatial environment existed in history. It provides the basis to the protection and development of the ancient caverns of Cuiguangyan, and it is a beneficial attempt for the application of the virtual reality technology in ancient cavern protection.
5	47	119	Medical 	 Rheumatoid Arthritis  	 Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies; Autoantibodies; Obesity; Periodontitis; Rheumatoid arthritis        	The aim of this study was to investigate the body mass index (BMI), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) status and the presence of periodontitis and IgG-1/IgG-2 antibodies against Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) in the first-degree relatives (FDRs) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and compare these variables with a control group of healthy individuals from the general population. In total, 100 FDR individuals and 200 healthy controls matched by age and gender were included. Rheumatologic and periodontal assessment was performed, and the presence of ACPAs and anti-P. gingivalis antibodies was evaluated. Groupwise comparisons were analysed using the McNemar and Wilcoxon tests. A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to establish the associations between BMI, ACPAs and periodontitis in both groups. In the FDR group, 70% of the subjects were female, with a mean age of 37.3 +/- 13 years. Obesity was observed in 17 and 7% of the FDRs and controls, respectively. ACPAs were found in 7% of the FDRs vs. 2.5% of the controls. Periodontitis was diagnosed in 79 and 56% of the FDRs and controls, respectively. Among the FDRs, 15% had severe periodontitis. There were associations in the FDR group related to the presence of obesity (OR 2.93, 95% CI 1.03-8.28), ACPAs (OR 2.45, 95% CI 0.7-8.32) and periodontitis (OR 3.70 95% CI 1.89-7.29). Regarding anti-P. gingivalis antibodies and smoking history, no differences were found between the groups. Obesity, ACPAs and periodontitis (diagnosis and severity) can be considered as relevant conditions associated with the development of RA in FDRs.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 Global positioning system; deformation monitoring; shift detection; cumulative sum chart; Shewhart chart        	Timely and correctly evaluating the quality of Global Positioning System (GPS) data is essential for reduction in the number of false alarms and missed detection of a GPS-based bridge deformation monitoring system. This paper investigates how to use the statistical process control technique, known as the cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart, for the detection of small but persistent shifts in the high-rate GPS carrier-phase measurements. First, a mathematical model for the shift detection based on the continuous hypothesis testing is established. The main features and implementation procedure of the CUSUM chart for the shift detection are then summarized, and the corresponding parameter selection method is discussed in detail. To meet the normality requirement of the CUSUM chart, a novel method that transfers the data to the Q-statistic by the estimated cumulative distribution functions is proposed according to the probability integral transform theory. This is followed by a simulation carried out to evaluate the detection performance of the CUSUM chart and exploit its advantages to the commonly used Shewhart chart for the high-rate GPS monitoring data with different shift sizes. Experimental results have showed that the CUSUM chart is sensitive to small persistent shifts compared to the Shewhart chart although it has a delay problem. The integration of CUSUM chart and Shewhart chart would be a reliable approach for the shift detection. Finally, an on-site dynamic monitoring experiment is carried out on a long-span bridge to validate the proposed approach's effectiveness in detecting an actual deformation shift, and the experimental results proved to be very encouraging.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 antisocial personality disorder; meditation; empathic functioning; inhibitory control; counseling        	Empathic functioning and inhibitory control deficits are two symptoms of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Despite their deleterious effects, limited research exists on interventions that would ameliorate these specific symptoms. We suggest that meditative interventions may help to increase empathic functioning and inhibitory control in ASPD individuals. Using Luria's working brain framework, we present research showing that meditative interventions influence the same brain regions associated with empathic functioning and inhibitory control. Implications for the counseling profession and directions for further research are discussed.
0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 computer programming education; virtual 3D environment; virtual blended learning; gamification; social media        	Virtual blended learning as the use of virtual 3D environments in education has already delivered utility in a number of cases. This article presents a concept and a prototype of a 3D environment used in the current semester to employ the new medium in programming education at universities. The concept brings gamification aspects as well as interaction mechanisms from social media to the virtual 3D environment. It thereby aims to reduce the large number of student dropouts due to failing the programming modules by motivating more and less capable students alike to an increased participation in the practical exercises. It is concluded that the concept is applicable in a much broader spectrum of exercise and tutorial settings.
5	10	82	Medical 	 Bipolar Disorder  	 Bipolar disorder; hospitalization; antimanic agents; antipsychotic agents; meta-analysis        	It is well recognized that medications have an important role to play in preventing relapse in bipolar disorder. The impact these treatments have on rates of admission to hospital in particular has been less well studied. We combined data on hospitalization from 11 randomized controlled trials in a network meta-analysis. We found that the published evidence demonstrates significant reductions in admission rates compared to placebo from lithium (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.59), valproate (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.90), a combination of lithium and valproate (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.90), carbamazepine (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.73) and olanzapine (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.43). The evidence base contributing to these estimates remains fairly small, leading to broad confidence intervals for estimates of effect. More precise estimates could be obtained if unpublished outcomes data from other trials in this area became available. Several pharmacological treatments appear to be effective at reducing the need for hospital admission in people with bipolar disorder.
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 Smart grid security; Smart meter; Non-technical loss; Colluded fraud; Malicious meter        	A Non-Technical Loss (NTL) fraud occurs when a fraudster tampers with a smart meter so that the meter registers less electricity consumption than the actual consumed amount, and therefore the utility becomes the victim who suffers the corresponding economic loss. In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.

6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 autotrophic pathways; reverse Krebs cycle; Wood-Ljungdahl pathway; origin of life; last common ancestor; (LCA    LUCA)       	In recent decades, a number of hypotheses on the autotrophic origin of life have been presented. These proposals invoke the emergence of reaction networks leading from CO or CO2 to the organic molecules required for life. It has also been suggested that the last (universal) common ancestor (LCA or LUCA) of all extant cell lineages was a chemolitho-autotrophic thermophilic anaerobe. The antiquity of some carbon fixation pathways, the phylogenetic basal distribution of some autotrophic organisms, and the catalytic properties of iron-sulfur minerals have been advanced in support of these ideas. Here we critically examine the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of enzymes that are essential for two of the most ancient autotrophic means of metabolism: the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle and the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of citryl-CoA synthetase and of citryl-CoA lyase, key enzymatic components of the rTCA cycle, and of CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, a key enzyme in the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, revealed that all three enzymes have undergone major lateral transfer events and therefore cannot be used as proof of the LCA's metabolic abilities nor as evidence of an autotrophic origin of life.
5	32	104	Medical 	 Lymphoma  	 whole-body ultra-low dose CT; spinal magnetic resonance imaging; mutlitple myeloma; low-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma; lytic bone lesions        	This study compared the diagnostic value of Whole-Body Ultra Low-Dose computed tomography (WBULDCT) with that of Spinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (SMRI) in identification of spinal bone marrow involvement in patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM). Thirty-five patients with histologically proven MM underwent WBULDCT and dedicated SMRI. Unenhanced WBULDCT was performed on a 256-slice scanner, with 120kV and 40mAs. SMRI was performed on a 15T magnet, with T1-turbo spin echo and T2-short tau inversion recovery sequences on sagittal plane. WBULDCT was compared with SMRI in terms of lesion detection, pattern and bone marrow involvement. The overall concordance between WBULDCT and SMRI in lesion detection was 767%, detecting (25/35) or excluding (8/35) involvement of the axial skeleton, while in 2/35 patients WBULDCT and SMRI were discordant in terms of axial skeleton involvement. The concordance in spinal distribution of lesions was 616% on cervical, 715% on dorsal, 864% on lumbar and 944% on sacral, while for the pattern of disease, it was 561% for the focal and 887% for the combined pattern. Cohen's kappa index was 085 (P<0001) assessing an excellent agreement. WBULDCT represents a useful diagnostic tool in the detection of spinal involvement of MM patients, offering detailed information about extra-axial involvement, which could be potentially missed with dedicated SMRI.
5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 low testosterone; stress; cortisol; ischemic events; blood pressure; Africans        	It is known that low testosterone (T) and high cortisol levels are associated with hypertension as well as with chronic stress, linking stress with elevated blood pressure (BP). However, the association between acute stress-, chronic stress responses and BP is not clear in Africans. Therefore, we examined the association between cortisol, psychological distress and BP responses in low-and high-T male subgroups. Beat-to-beat and ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM) and electrocardiogram measures were obtained. Serum samples were collected and analyzed for sex hormones and cortisol. Chronic psychological distress was verified with the General Health Questionnaire and acute stress with the cold pressor test. More chronic psychological distress was observed in both low-and high-T Africans compared with the Caucasians. The low-T Africans tended to have more ischemic events (P = 0.06) and ABPM values (P <= 0.01) than any of the other groups. Both chronic distress (cortisol) and acute stress (total peripheral resistance cold pressor responses) were associated with ABPM in the low-T African group. Acute and chronic stress may contribute to increased BP in low-T African men. Their cortisol and vascular responses supported a tendency for ischemia, increasing their risk for coronary artery disease.

3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 High-kappa dielectric; MOS device; Trapped charge distribution; TCAD simulation        	The effect of rapid thermal annealing on the oxide charge distribution of Al/HfO/SiO/Si metal-oxide-semiconductor structures are studied using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations and experiments. The simulated electrical characteristics are compared with experimentally obtained data. The interface traps are found to be nonuniform in nature and laterally distributed following a Gaussian profile. The distribution of interface trap charges arises because of spatial electric field variation in the oxide film upon gate bias application. The interface trap density is found to decrease with increase in annealing temperature. It is further observed that, at higher annealing temperature, the fixed oxide charge density increases due to interfacial Hf silicate formation.
2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 Media violence; Intervention; Experimental evaluation; Longitudinal study        	Several longitudinal studies and meta-analytic reviews have demonstrated that exposure to violent media is linked to aggression over time. However, evidence on effective interventions to reduce the use of violent media and promote critical viewing skills is limited. The current study examined the efficacy of an intervention designed to reduce the use of media violence and aggression in adolescence, covering a total period of about 12 months. A sample of 683 7th and 8th graders in Germany (50.1% girls) were assigned to two conditions: a 5-week intervention and a no-intervention control group. Measures of exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior were obtained about 3 months prior to the intervention (T1) and about 7 months post-intervention (T2). The intervention group showed a significantly larger decrease in the use of violent media from T1 to T2 than the control group. Participants in the intervention group also scored significantly lower on self-reported aggressive behavior (physical aggression and relational aggression) at T2 than those in the control group, but the effect was limited to those with high levels of initial aggression. This effect was mediated by an intervention-induced decrease in the normative acceptance of aggression. No gender differences in program efficacy were found. The results show that a 5-week school-based intervention can produce changes in the use of media violence, aggressive norms, and behaviors sustained over several months.
5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 Cortex Dictamni; Antioxidant activity; Hepatoprotective; Carbon tetrachloride; Nrf2        	AIM To investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Cortex Dictamni aqueous extract (CDAE) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage in rats. METHODS The in vitro antioxidant effect of CDAE was investigated using alpha, alpha-diphenyl-beta-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), beta-carotene bleaching, reducing power, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assays. A linoleic acid system, including ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assays, was used to evaluate the inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of CDAE against CCl4-induced liver damage were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Silymarin was used as a positive control. Liver damage was assessed by determining hepatic histopathology and liver marker enzymes in serum. Enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant levels and lipid peroxide content were measured in the liver. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) protein expression was measured via immunohistochemical staining. Nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (gamma-GCSc) protein expression was measured by Western blot. RESULTS Our results showed that CDAE exhibited a strong antioxidant activity in vitro. CDAE scavenged DPPH and ABTS radicals in a dose-dependent manner. CDAE inhibited lipid peroxidation with a lipid peroxide inhibition rate of 40.6% +/- 5.2%. In the FTC and TBA assays, CDAE significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation (P < 0.01). In vivo histopathological studies indicated that CCl4-induced liver injury was alleviated following CDAE treatment in rats of both sexes. CDAE (160 and 320 mg/kg) significantly prevented CCl4-induced elevations of alkaline phosphatase, glutamate pyruvate transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels in rats of both sexes (P < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001). Moreover, CDAE restored the decreased activities of hepatic antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione, which were induced by CCl4 treatment. CDAE significantly suppressed the up-regulation of CYP2E1 and promoted Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and gamma-GCSc protein expression. CONCLUSION CDAE exhibits good antioxidant performance in vitro, with marked radical-scavenging and anti-lipid peroxidation activities. CDAE is effective in preventing CCl4-induced hepatic damage in rats of both sexes. The hepatoprotective activity of CDAE may be attributable to its antioxidant activity, which may involve Keap1-Nrf2-mediated antioxidant regulation.
5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 Battlefield Acupuncture; Microcurrent Point Stimulation; Heart Rate Variability (HRV); Vagal Tone (HF); Stress        	Introduction: This is a detailed comparative analysis of the effects of direct-current (DC) microcurrent point stimulation (MPS) on the autonomic nervous system, when applied in the Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) protocol for 8 patients with histories of pain. Methods: Evaluations entailed a standard baseline visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, saliva cortisol, and a baseline status of 27 autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions, for a total of 29 markers, all repeated prior to and following electrotherapy on this cohort of patients. Results: The ANS response to microcurrent point electrical nerve stimulation reflected a statistically significant pre-post improvement in 8 of the 29 markers collected: (1) pain on the VAS scale was reduced by 63% (2.0625 points; 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.2745-2.8505; P=0.0001); (2) heart rate variability improved by 42% (662.375 points; 95% CI: -1273.675 to -51.075; P=0.037); (3) high frequency-vagal tone improved by 56% (231.25 points; 95% CI: -430.42 to -31.58); P=0.029); (4) exercise tolerance increased by 22% (9.500 points; 95% CI: -16.747 to -2.253; P=0.017); (5) parasympathetic activity improved by 38% (14.000 points; 95% CI: -23.202 to -4.798; P=0.009); (6) stress was reduced by 27% (39.125 points; 95% CI: 1.945-76,305); P=0.042); (7) the PTGi [photoplethysmography index] cardiac marker of endothelial function, arterial blood flow, and ANS regulation improved by 48% (21.5125 points; 95% CI: -35.441754 to 7.5832461; P=0.008); (8) cardiac marker PTGVLFi [Photoplethysmography very low frequency index]-an ANS regulation marker of endothelial function and an indicator of ss-cell activity had a statistically significant reduction of 36% (9.250 points; 95% CI: 1.062-17.438; P=0.032). Salivary cortisol decreased by 14% (0.08286 points; 95% CI: -0.1182 to 0.28384; P=0.352). Conclusions: The positive and impressive results in this study showed significant improvement in several parameters of ANS function and reduction in pain and cortisol levels. If replicated, this study paves the way for use of DC MPS applied to the BFA protocol for other pathologies that are known to be affected by sympathetic nervous system activation.
1	7	24	ECE 	 Microcontroller  	 DC-DC power converters; discontinuous conduction mode multiphase switching converters        	The authors present the control principle of the multiphase interleaved DC-DC converter that can be used to vastly reduce output current ripple of the converter. The control algorithm can be easily implemented by using microcontroller without current loop in each phase. The converter works in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) but close to boundary conduction mode (BCM). The DC-DC converter with such a control algorithm is useful in applications that do not require precise current adjustment. The prototype of the converter has been built. The experimental results of the current ripple are presented in the paper.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 oncostatin M; retinoic acid; cartilage; MMP-13; TIMP-1        	Objectives. Retinoic acid (RetA) and oncostatin M (OSM) have both been shown to mediate potent effects with respect to extracellular matrix integrity. This study assesses the effects of a RetA + OSM combination on cartilage catabolism. Methods. Animal and human cartilage samples were used to assess the ability of RetA + OSM to promote the release of collagen and proteoglycan fragments, which was determined by measuring glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline, respectively. Total collagenolytic and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) inhibitory activities were determined by bioassay, whilst gene expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and TIMP-1 were determined by northern blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess the presence of MMP-1 and -13 in resorbing cartilage explants. Results. Both agents alone induced proteoglycan release from bovine cartilage, whilst RetA-induced collagen release was variable. Reproducible and synergistic collagenolysis was observed with RetA + OSM, which appeared to be due to MMP-13. Similar collagen release was observed from porcine cartilage. Conversely, no collagen release was seen with human articular cartilage. In primary human chondrocytes, RetA + OSM failed to induce MMP-1 or -13 but caused a significant increase in TIMP-1 expression. Conclusions. These novel observations show that the combination of RetA + OSM has profound effects on cartilage matrix turnover, but these effects are species-specific. A better understanding of the mechanism by which this combination differentially regulates MMP and TIMP expression in human chondrocytes could provide valuable insight into new therapeutic strategies aimed at the prevention of cartilage destruction.

The doctor can monitor the patient's physiological condition by TMIS, the confidentiality of this sensitive data should be protected, which is the key issue in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Guo et al. proposed an efficient and provably secure certificateless public key encryption scheme for TMIS. They claimed that their scheme is secure under the random oracle model. Unfortunately, by giving concrete attack, we find that their scheme actually does not reach the security as they claimed. Then we propose an improved scheme to make up for the defect in their scheme.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Ozonation; Dielectric barrier discharge; Nitric oxide; Chemical oxygen demand; Biological oxygen demand        	A modular typed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) device is designed and tested for air and water remediation. The module is made of a number of DBD tubes that can be arranged in series or parallel. Each of the DBD tubes comprises inner electrode enclosed with dielectric barrier and arranged as such to provide a gap for the passage of gases. Non-thermal plasma generated in the gap effectively creates gaseous chemical reactions. Its efficacy in the remediation of gas stream containing high NOx, similar to diesel emission and wastewater containing latex, are presented. A six tubes DBD module has successfully removed more than 80% of nitric oxide from the gas stream. In another arrangement, oxygen was fed into a two tubes DBD to generate ozone for treatment of wastewater. Samples of wastewater were collected from a treatment pond of a rubber vulcanization pilot plant. The water pollution load was evaluated by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) values. Preliminary results showed some improvement (about 13%) on the COD after treatment and at the same time had increased the BOD5 by 42%. This results in higher BOD5/COD ratio after ozonation which indicate better biodegradability of the wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 amalgam; Class I and Class II cavities; clinical trial; composite resin; high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement; Minamata Convention; minimum intervention dentistry; resin coating        	Background: With the Minamata Convention the use of mercury will be phased down, and this undoubtedly will have an effect on dental treatment regimens and economic resources. Composite resin restorations are considered viable alternatives to amalgam fillings; however, these will not be covered completely by health insurance systems in many countries. Recently, a high-viscosity glass-ionomer cement (hvGIC) processed with a resinous coating (RC) has been introduced, and has been marketed as a restorative material in load-bearing Class I cavities (and in Class II cavities with limited size), thus serving as a possible alternative to amalgam fillings. Objective: To discuss the outcome based on the evaluation presented in Part I of this paper, and to critically appraise the methodologies of the various studies. Results: Two of the included studies were industry-funded, and status of the other clinical trials remained unclear. Quality of study reporting was considered perfectible. The use of a light-cured nanofilled resin coating material would seem advantageous, at least when regarding short-and medium term outcomes. Conclusion: Within the respective indications and cavity geometries, the hvGIC/RC approach would seem promising, could merge the phase-down of mercury and the objectives of minimally invasive treatment to some extent, and might be a restorative alternative for patients suffering from allergies or not willing to afford other sophisticated or expensive techniques. These recommendations are based on studies evaluating EQUIA Fil (GC), but are not transferable to clinical perspectives of the glass hybrid successor product (EQUIA Forte; GC).
5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 dementia; nurse; nurse education; pain; palliative care        	Aims and objectives. To explore hospice, acute care and nursing home nurses' experiences of pain management for people with advanced dementia in the final month of life. To identify the challenges, facilitators and practice areas requiring further support. Background. Pain management in end-stage dementia is a fundamental aspect of end-of-life care; however, it is unclear what challenges and facilitators nurses experience in practice, whether these differ across care settings, and whether training needs to be tailored to the context of care. Design. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis to examine data. Methods. Twenty-four registered nurses caring for people dying with advanced dementia were recruited from 10 nursing homes, three hospices and two acute hospitals across a region of the UK. Interviews were conducted between June 2014-September 2015. Results. Three core themes were identified: challenges administering analgesia, the nurse-physician relationship, and interactive learning and practice development. Patient-related challenges to pain management were universal across care settings; nurse-and organisation-related barriers differed between settings. A need for interactive learning and practice development, particularly in pharmacology, was identified. Conclusions. Achieving pain management in practice was highly challenging. A number of barriers were identified; however, the manner and extent to which these impacted on nurses differed across hospice, nursing home and acute care settings. Needs-based training to support and promote practice development in pain management in end-stage dementia is required. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses considered pain management fundamental to end-of-life care provision; however, nurses working in acute care and nursing home settings may be undersupported and under-resourced to adequately manage pain in people dying with advanced dementia. Nurse-to-nurse mentoring and ongoing needs-assessed interactive case-based learning could help promote practice development in this area. Nurses require continuing professional development in pharmacology.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 supraspinatus tear; glenohumeral joint; translation; shoulder biomechanics; pitching        	Background: Supraspinatus tears are common in pitchers. However, the effect of these tears on glenohumeral (GH) mechanics is incompletely understood. Purpose/Hypothesis: To describe the effect of supraspinatus tears and repairs on GH kinematics during an abbreviated throwing motion using the intact shoulder girdle. The hypothesis was that supraspinatus tears would lead to an increase of GH translation in the coronal plane and supraspinatus repairs would restore GH kinematics. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Six shoulders from 3 fresh-frozen cadavers were tested in a novel 7 degrees of freedom robotic testing system. Torsos were mounted and the wrist was pinned to an actuator mounted on an upper frame. After the deltoid was removed, the shoulders were studied during an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from maximum external rotation to the midcoronal plane to establish a baseline. The ATM was repeated after creation of a 1-cm supraspinatus tear, after creation of a 3-cm supraspinatus tear, and after repair with a transosseous equivalent (TOE) technique. Retroreflective bone markers and high-speed infrared cameras were used to measure GH kinematics and calculate the center of rotation of the GH joint (CORGH) instantaneously. Results: The 1- and 3-cm supraspinatus tears did not significantly alter GH translation. The TOE repair shifted the CORGH posteriorly, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the overall GH translation in all 3 planes (P = .003, .019, and .026, for x-y, y-z, and x-z planes, respectively). Conclusion: In contrast to a TOE repair of the supraspinatus tendon, isolated supraspinatus tears did not perturb GH kinematics in this cadaveric model of the throwing shoulder. Clinical Relevance: In throwing athletes, treatment of rotator cuff tears should be addressed with caution to avoid an unintended alteration in GH kinematics due to overtightening of the tendon.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 Autophagy; Inflammatory bowel disease; Genome-wide association study; Ulcerative colitis; Crohn's disease        	Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a complex series of interactions between susceptibility genes, the environment, and the immune system.Recently, some studies provided strong evidence that the process of autophagy affects several aspects of mucosal immune responses. Autophagy is a cellular stress response that plays key roles in physiological processes, such as innate and adaptive immunity, adaptation to starvation, degradation of aberrant proteins or organelles, antimicrobial defense, and protein secretion. Dysfunctional autophagy is recognized as a contributing factor in many chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Autophagy plays multiple roles in IBD pathogenesis by altering processes that include intracellular bacterial killing, antimicrobial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, goblet cell function, proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages, antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in enterocytes. Recent studies have identified susceptibility genes involved in autophagy, such as NOD2, ATG16L1, and IRGM, and active research is ongoing all over the world. The aim of this review is a systematic appraisal of the current literature to provide a better understanding of the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of IBD. Understanding these mechanisms will bring about new strategies for the treatment and prevention of IBD.
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 Data Quality; Databases; Multi-Valued Data        	In the setting of relational databases, the schema of the database provides a context in which the data should be interpreted. As a consequence, the quality of a relational database depends strongly on the assumption that data fits this context description. In this paper, we investigate the case where the information provided by an attribute value exceeds the framework provided by the schema. It is shown that such an information overflow can have two orthogonal causes: (i) data about multiple attributes are jointly stored as one attribute and (ii) data about multiple tuples are jointly stored as one tuple. Needless to say, such erroneous information storage deteriorates the quality of the database. In this paper, it is investigated how data quality can be improved by a split operator. The major difficulty hereby is to take into account the constraints that are present in a relational database. A generic algorithm is provided and tested on the well-know Cora dataset.
5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 Apoptosis; Ischemic heart disease; Outcome; Heart failure        	Apoptosis plays an important role in the myocardial loss after acute myocardial infarction and participates in the process of subsequent left ventricular remodeling and development of symptomatic heart failure. Finding a sensitive apoptotic marker that would help in prognostic stratification of patients after acute myocardial infarction and offer new therapeutic strategies is thus of a great importance. Several studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) represents a very promising marker of prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. This review article provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of apoptosis in ischemic heart disease and highlights potentially beneficial apoptotic markers in clinical practice.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Network functions virtualization; Network security; Virtualized network function; Security threats        	The advent of network functions virtualization (NFV) has revolutionized numerous network-based applications due to its several benefits such as flexibility, manageability, scalability, and security. By the software-based virtualization of network functions on a single infrastructure, NFV provides users with a framework that dynamically provisions various network services in a flexible manner. However, NFV faces several security challenges (e.g., multi-tenancy and live migration) which make it vulnerable to some cybersecurity attacks (e.g., side-channel attacks and shared resource misuse attacks). In this paper, we provide an overview of NFV, discuss potentially serious security threats on NFV and introduce effective countermeasures to mitigate those threats. Finally, we suggest some practical solutions to provide a trustworthy platform for NFV. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 Clostridia; Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis; Rice callus; Paddy field soil; Soil oxygen condition        	Plant residues are one of the main sources of soil organic matter in paddy fields, and elucidation of the bacterial communities decomposing plant residues was important to understand their function and roles, as the microbial decomposition of plant residues is linked to soil fertility. We conducted a DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment to elucidate the bacterial community assimilating 13-carbon (C-13) derived from plant residue under an anoxic soil condition. In addition, we compared the bacterial community with that under the oxic soil condition, which was elucidated in our previous study (Lee et al. in Soil Biol Biochem 43:814-822, 2011). We used the C-13-labeled dried rice callus cells as a model of rice plant residue. A paddy field soil was incubated with unlabeled and C-13-labeled callus cells. DNA extracted from the soils was subjected to buoyant density gradient centrifugation to fractionate C-13-enriched DNA. Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of bacterial 16S rDNA band patterns and band sequencing method were used to evaluate bacterial community. DGGE analysis showed that the band patterns in the C-13-enriched fractions were distinctly changed over time, while the changes in the community structure before fractionation were minor. Sequencing of the C-13-labeled DGGE bands revealed that Clostridia were a major group in the bacterial communities incorporating the callus-derived carbon although Gram-negative bacteria, and Actinobacteria also participated in the carbon flow from the callus under the anoxic condition. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and Actinobacteria increased on 14 days after the onset of incubation, suggesting that the callus was decomposed by diverse bacterial members on this phase. When the bacterial groups incorporating the C-13 were compared between under anoxic and oxic soil conditions, the composition was largely different under the two opposite conditions. However, some members of Gram-negative bacteria were commonly found under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions. The majority of bacterial members assimilating the callus carbon was Clostridia in the soil under anoxic conditions. However, several Gram-negative bacterial members, such as Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, also participated in the decomposition of callus under anoxic soil conditions. Our study showed that carbon flow into the diverse bacterial members during the callus decomposition and the distinctiveness of the bacterial communities was formed under the anoxic and oxic soil conditions.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 Privacy-preserving; Third-party auditing; Ambient intelligence systems        	Due to limited resources of actors, third-party auditing has vital significance for ambient intelligence systems, which ensures the integrity of data stored in the information manager. However, Current public key based third-party auditing schemes are costly, while simple MAC based third-party auditing schemes can't fulfill two security requirements, namely the privacy-preserving and the integrity-against-TPA requirements. Taking both security and efficiency into account, this paper proposes a novel simple MAC based third-party auditing scheme, which is much more efficient than current public key based schemes, while still fulfills the above two security requirements. Therefore, it is feasible to be deployed in ambient intelligence systems.
5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 Testosterone; Hypogonadism; Sexual dysfunction; Erectile dysfunction; Atherosclerosis; Atherogenesis; Coronary artery disease; Myocardial infarction        	Purpose of Review According to an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline published in June 2010, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) should be administered only to men who are hypogonadal with documented low testosterone level on two morning measurements. This recommendation was based on previous studies that did not show an increased risk in cardiovascular events with TRT. In contrast, recent studies did show an increased risk which prompted the FDA to investigate further. Recent Findings Multiple studies suggested an increased risk in cardiovascular events among groups of men prescribed TRT. Summary There is recent evidence that TRT can be associated with higher cardiovascular risks, while these risks are still not well established, and more well-designed trials are needed. Physicians should always be cautious when prescribing TRT to their patients. Potential risks should be discussed with each patient, and TRT requires regular monitoring to help minimize side effects.
0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 Multiple Criteria Decision Making; Cloud Service Provider Selection; Fuzzy        	Cloud Computing is a specialized form of Distributed computing in which the resources such as storage, processors, memory etc. are completely abstracted from the consumer. The number of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who offer computing as a service has increased in recent times and often the customers need to interact with unknown service providers to carry out transactions. In such an open and anonymous environments, trust helps to build consumer confidence and provides a reliable environment for them. A trust based ranking system could also help them to choose between the services as per their requirement. In this paper, multi criteria decision making methods have been used to rank the service providers based on their infrastructure parameters. A combination of analytic and fuzzy method gives a better trust estimate as compared to an analytic method alone.
0	6	6	CS 	 Image processing  	 Percolating micro-structures; Clustering; Image processing; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Carbon-based nanofluids        	The primary working mechanism behind nanofluids thermal conductivity can be distinguished as one of the most controversial issues of nanofluids. Between several theories proposed in literature, nanopartides' clustering is the sole mechanism that can be observed even at the micro-scale level. Several parameters including nanofluid preparation method, particles concentration, particles morphology, temperature, and elapsed time are experimentally altered to investigate the role of nanoparticles micro-clusters in nanofluids thermal conductivity. It is observed that a minor variation in the altering parameters, would lead a remarkable change in the micro-clusters configuration and subsequently, in the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In this paper, it is focused on this phenomenon by introducing a new application of image processing as a tool to study the morphological characteristics of micron sized clusters. Through this approach, it is demonstrated that higher thermal conductivity is obtained when particles micro-clusters are well percolated all over the base fluid. As a result, well-diffused percolating micro-structures are known to have a significant role in heat conduction of nanofluids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	4	76	Medical 	 Anxiety  	 burning mouth syndrome; cortisol; alpha-amylase; saliva        	Purpose: The aim of the study was to compare salivary cortisol and -amylase levels and psychological profiles in patients with burning mouth syndrome (BMS) and healthy subjects. Methods and Materials: Spitting method was used to collect unstimulated salivary. Salivary cortisol and -amylase levels were determined using ELISA and the Caraway starch-iodine technique. SLC-90 questionnaire was used to determine the psychological profiles. Results: The difference between mean of salivary cortisol levels in patients with BMS and in healthy subjects was not significant (4.50 3.68 ng/mL vs. 3.69 +/- 3.07 ng/mL, p = 0.377). The difference between mean of -amylase levels in the BMS patients and healthy subjects was significant (351.68 +/- 142.5 and 146.22 +/- 130.4, p = 0.001). Note that, 83.4% and 18% of the patients in the case and control groups had psychological problems (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The results showed higher salivary levels of cortisol and -amylase in patients with BMS compared to healthy individuals. Psychological problem was prevalent in patients.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Inflammation; Immunology; Macula; Degeneration        	Purpose To evaluate the prevalence of large drusen in a uveitis clinic population. Design Retrospective, cohort study. Methods Patients with primary, non-infectious uveitis 55years or older who were seen at the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health from 2004 through August 2013 were reviewed using electronic medical records and photographic databases. Patients were classified as having age-related macular degeneration (AMD) if either eye had large drusen, geographic atrophy or neovascular AMD according to definitions used by the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group (EDPRG). The expected number of cases and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for large drusen were estimated based on EDPRG estimates. Results We identified 177 patients aged 55years as having primary non-infectious uveitis; 170 (96.0%) had gradable fundus photos. Average age was 65.07.5years (range 55-87), and 87 were non-Hispanic white, 66 non-Hispanic black, 6 Hispanic white and 11 of other race/ethnicity. Large drusen were identified in four patients (2.4%; 95% CI 0.6 to 6.0). No patients were identified to have late AMD. In the uveitis cohort, the SMR for cases of large drusen, which was adjusted for age, was calculated to be 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for the whole cohort, 0.28 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.79) for non-Hispanic whites and 0.46 (95% CI 0.14 to 1.29) for non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusions Large drusen prevalence among patients with uveitis 55years of age appears less than the prevalence in the general US population after accounting for differences in age distribution, especially for non-Hispanic whites. Although the racial and gender distribution in this study population is not directly representative of the general US population, results of this study suggest possible sparing of patients with uveitis from AMD. A larger systematic study with greater power would be needed to confirm these findings.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Analog-to-digital conversion; sigma-delta; time based; voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)        	Due to technology scaling, the design of the conventional-type analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which uses an operational amplifier as one of its building blocks, becomes more difficult. In this brief, new techniques to design time-based ADC (TADC), which uses a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), are proposed. The VCO is followed by a time-to-digital converter, implemented in a Sigma Delta architecture. A novel architecture, using a multibit, nonlinear internal quantizer and a feedback digital-to-time converter, implemented by using phase interpolation, is employed to compensate the nonlinear transfer curve of the VCO. Dynamic element matching and calibration are used to improve the robustness of the TADC against mismatch. The TADC uses an implicit sample and hold that relaxes the bounds on input frequency. A TADC implemented in 0.13-mu m CMOS technology achieves a measured signal-to-noise + distortion ratio of 60.2 dB and a dynamic range of 11 b for a bandwidth of 2 MHz.
0	11	11	CS 	 Structured Storage  	 Environmental data; Data management; Working group repository        	Biological and environmental changes are creating a growing demand for historical and global data sets. Comparing up-to-date ecological and biological findings with historical statements has become a major part of scientific work in the field of ecology. This evaluation and comparison procedure is very time-consuming while the availability of raw data is very low. Comparisons between original findings if available require a lot of work from print publication to digitalization or transformation to appropriate data formats. The effective use of working capacity is a general issue and has become important, should the use of information technologies be invoked to minimize time-wasting copy and paste operations. In this paper we aim to present a working repository for terrestrial biological data. The implementation of this type of data repository will provide various services to participating scientists as long as the final aim is the publication of these repositories. Furthermore, the security and long-term availability of environmental data is an issue of increasing importance to the scientific community. Unrepeatable sampling events and any data thus obtained are precious in time series analysis. For this reason, a well-structured storage of data is necessary for easy accessibility, retrieval and comparability. This is an important issue for the community of environmental scientists. The need to construct and implement repositories should prevail against all hitches and we are therefore describing our on-going task with the primary population of this kind of data repository. A biological and ecological information system is a matter of public interest and should also be a key issue for ecologists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.
2	18	51	Psychology  	 Problem-solving  	 Positive organizational scholarship; Cultural distance; International alliances        	Purpose - While previous studies have primarily assumed dysfunctional effects of cultural distance in joint ventures and M&A, this paper elucidates from a positive organizational scholarship perspective how perceived cultural distance can advance firms' new product development within non-equity alliances. The purpose of this paper is to explain how perceived cultural distance stimulates task discourse that supports alliance partners' employees in recognizing and applying culture-related differences as complementary problem-solving potentials. Due to a lower integration level in non-equity alliances compared to joint ventures or M&A, this paper assumes that the positive effects outweigh the negative effects of cultural distance. Design/methodology/approach - This study applies structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized effects on a sample of 246 international alliances in the manufacturing industry. Findings - The analysis mainly supports the hypothesized model and unravels how positive effects can emerge from perceived cultural distance. Practical implications - The findings provide managerial implications. Alliance managers should note that cultural distance can have positive and negative effects, and thus it is not a barrier per se in alliances. Firms can benefit from cultural distance if they are able to leverage culture-specific complementarities through task discourse among partners in alliances. Originality/value - The manuscript uses a unique data set of 246 international alliances from the global manufacturing industry. The manuscript has not been published elsewhere.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 Environmental management initiatives; Sustainable public transport infrastructure project; MCDM (multiple criteria decision-making); Activity-based costing (ABC); Carbon footprint; Zero-one goal programming (ZOGP)        	An optimal sustainable public transport infrastructure project portfolio selection requires an environment management strategy for both the social and economic development. This study considers the application of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that can be applied to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects, taking into account a range of transport, social, financial and environmental criteria. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strategic decision making under resource constraints and the carbon footprint factor, a zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) model is developed to facilitate an optimal portfolio of sustainable public transport infrastructure projects in Taiwan. The resulting data shows that the perspective of sustaihable transport and the criterion of decreasing traffic energy consumption are the most significant evaluation factors, and that the Tamhai Light Rail (TLR) Project and Tambai Expressway (TE) Project comprise by far the optimal portfolio of sustainable transport infrastructure projects which strengthen the connection between activity-based costing (ABC) evaluation and carbon footprint in a life cycle assessment. The integrated approach is a practical and useful tool for providing solution-related information for sustainable public transport infrastructure projects, and to help managers incorporate environment costs into decision-making processes.

Although the QS gene cluster (comQXPA) has been identified in the genome sequence of some bacilli, the QS system B. licheniformis has not been investigated in detail, and its QSM (ComX pheromone) has not been identified. Given the importance of this antagonistic bacterium as an industrial workhorse, this study was aimed to elucidate B. licheniformis NCIMB-8874 QS. The results obtained from bioinformatics studies on the whole genome sequence of this strain confirmed the presence of essential quorum sensing-related genes. Although polymorphism was verified in three proteins of this cluster, ComQ, precursor-ComX and ComP, the transcription factor ComA was confirmed as the most conserved protein. The cell-cell communication of B. licheni-formis NCIMB-8874 was investigated through further elucidation of the ComX pheromone as 13-amino acid peptide. The peptide sequence of the pheromone has been described through biochemical characterisation.
0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Taxonomy; Classification; Software engineering; Systematic mapping study        	Context: Software Engineering (SE) is an evolving discipline with new subareas being continuously developed and added. To structure and better understand the SE body of knowledge, taxonomies have been proposed in all SE knowledge areas. Objective: The objective of this paper is to characterize the state-of-the-art research on SE taxonomies. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted, based on 270 primary studies. Results: An increasing number of SE taxonomies have been published since 2000 in a broad range of venues, including the top SE journals and conferences. The majority of taxonomies can be grouped into the following SWEBOI(knowledge areas: construction (19.55%), design (19.55%), requirements (15.50%) and maintenance (11.81%). Illustration (45.76%) is the most frequently used approach for taxonomy validation. Hierarchy (53.14%) and faceted analysis (39.48%) are the most frequently used classification structures. Most taxonomies rely on qualitative procedures to classify subject matter instances, but in most cases (86.53%) these procedures are not described in sufficient detail. The majority of the taxonomies (97%) target unique subject matters and many taxonomy-papers are cited frequently. Most SE taxonomies are designed in an ad-hoc way. To address this issue, we have revised an existing method for developing taxonomies in a more systematic way. Conclusion: There is a strong interest in taxonomies in SE, but few taxonomies are extended or revised. Taxonomy design decisions regarding the used classification structures, procedures and descriptive bases are usually not well described and motivated. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 Continuous-time marginal electricity price; generation trajectory; ramping trajectory; variational problem        	The current practice of discrete-time electricity pricing starts to fall short in providing an accurate economic signal reflecting the continuous-time variations of load and generation schedule in power systems. This paper introduces the fundamental mathematical theory of continuous-time marginal electricity pricing. We first formulate the continuous-time unit commitment problem as a constrained variational problem, and subsequently define the continuous-time economic dispatch (ED) problem where the binary commitment variables are fixed to their optimal values. We then prove that the continuous-time marginal electricity price equals to the Lagrange multiplier of the variational power balance constraint in the continuous-time ED problem. The proposed continuous-time marginal price is not only dependent to the incremental generation cost rate, but also to the incremental ramping cost rate of the units, thus embedding the ramping costs in calculation of the marginal electricity price. The numerical results demonstrate that the continuous-time marginal price manifests the behavior of the constantly varying load and generation schedule in power systems.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 cardiac resynchronization; clinical outcomes; bundle branch block (BBB); permanent His bundle pacing (HBP)        	Permanent His Bundle Pacing Long-term right ventricular (RV) apical pacing has been associated with an increased risk of death, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Alternative sites for RV pacing have not proven to be superior to RV apical pacing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using a biventricular (BiV) lead system is indicated for patients with a low left ventricular ejection fraction and QRS prolongation, but there remains about a 25-30% nonresponse rate. CRT has been less effective for nonleft bundle branch block conduction delay and with normal/low normal left ventricular function. Over the past decade, there have been more data on the feasibility and advantages of pacing at the His Bundle (HB) region. We review the anatomy and physiology of the HB, the available data on permanent HB pacing, its current and potential future applications.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Gene detection; Correlation; Maximal ratio combining; Period-3 filter; Bayesian classification        	The rapid advances in the field of computational genomics and bioinformatics have motivated the development of innovative engineering methods for data acquisition, interpretation, and analysis. With the help of the later methods, many processes in molecular biology can be modeled and further analyzed. Identification and discovery of the coding regions in the genomic structure using computational algorithms is a clear example of such processes. This work proposes a novel application of well-known principles and concepts from communications theory and digital signal processing for the detection of protein coding regions in prokaryotic genomes. The proposed algorithm employs a polyphase complex mapping scheme to provide a numerical representation of the genomic sequences involved in the analysis. It then utilizes concepts in communications theory such as correlation, the maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm, and filtering to generate a signal whose peaks and troughs signify coding and noncoding regions, respectively. The proposed algorithm is applied to several prokaryotic genome sequences. Two Bayesian classifiers are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The obtained simulation results show that the algorithm is able to efficiently and accurately identify protein coding regions with sensitivity and specificity values comparable to well-known gene detection methods in prokaryotes such as GLIMMER and GeneMark. This further proves the relevance of using communications theory concepts for genomic sequence analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 copper intrauterine device; emergency contraception; levonorgestrel; postcoital contraception; ulipristal acetate        	Purpose of review Emergency contraception provides a critical and time-sensitive opportunity for women to prevent undesired pregnancy after intercourse. Both access and available options for emergency contraception have changed over the last several years. Recent findings Emergency contraceptive pills can be less effective in obese women. The maximum achieved serum concentration of levonorgestrel (LNG) is lower in obese women than women of normal BMI, and doubling the dose of LNG (3 mg) increases its concentration maximum, approximating the level in normal BMI women receiving one dose of LNG. Repeated use of both LNG and ulipristal acetate (UPA) is well tolerated. Hormonal contraception can be immediately started following LNG use, but should be delayed for 5 days after UPA use to avoid dampening the efficacy of UPA. The copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the only IUD approved for emergency contraception (and the most effective method of emergency contraception), but use of LNG IUD as emergency contraception is currently being investigated. Accurate knowledge about emergency contraception remains low both for patients and healthcare providers. Summary Emergency contraception is an important yet underutilized tool available to women to prevent pregnancy. Current options including copper IUD and emergency contraceptive pills are safe and well tolerated. Significant gaps in knowledge of emergency contraception on both the provider and user level exist, as do barriers to expedient access of emergency contraception.
5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 Cardiovascular diseases; Iran; Demographic changes; DALY; Modelling        	Background: Estimating the burden of non-communicable diseases particularly cardiovascular disease (CVD) is essential for health management and policymaking. In this paper, we used a regression model to estimate the future impact of demographic changes on the burden of CVD in Iran during the next two decades. Methods: Disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were used to estimate the future burden of CVD in Iran. A regression model was used to estimate DALY caused by CVD in the Iranian population aged 30-100 yr, stratified by age group and sex. The predicted population of Iranians aged >= 30 yr was entered into the model and DALY were calculated over 2005-2025. To assess the areas of uncertainty in the model, we did sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo Simulation. Results: In the year 2005, there were 847309 DALYs caused by CVD in Iranian adults aged >= 30 yr. This figure will nearly be 1728836 DALYs in 2025. In other words, just because of the aging, DALY related to CVD will increase more than two-fold in 2025 compared with 2005. The burden of CVD was higher in men (443235) than in women (404235) in 2005; but in 2025, the difference will be less (867639 vs. 861319). Conclusion: The burden of CVD will increase steeply in Iran over 2005-2025, mainly because of the aging population. Therefore, more attention is needed to deal with the impact of CVD in the following decades in Iran.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 Atrial fibrillation; Anticoagulants; Bleeding; Underweight; Thromboembolism        	BACKGROUND There is a paucity of evidence regarding the effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in underweight patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs in underweight AF patients. METHODS We analyzed 1353 AF patients who were prescribed NOACs according to their body mass index (BMI): underweight (UW: n = 62, BMI25.0 kg/m2). We analyzed the association between clinical outcomes and BMI. RESULTS During the median 7 months (interquartile range 3-10 months) of follow-up, there were 29 major bleeding events, 11 thromboembolic events, and 15 deaths. The risks of major bleeding and all-cause death were significantly higher in the UW group compared to the NW group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 4.135, 950/0 confidence interval [CI] 1.442-11.854, P =.008; adjusted HR 10.524, 95% CI 2.949-37.561, P < .001) and the OW group (adjusted HR 5.352, 95% CI 1.597-17.935, P = .007; adjusted HR 11.385, 95% CI 2.523-51.386, P = .002). However, there was no significant difference in the risk of thromboembolism among these groups. CONCLUSION In AF patients taking NOACs, being underweight was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding and all-cause death compared with being normal weight or overweight to obese, whereas the risk of thromboembolism was not different. Dose reduction should be considered in underweight patients who are at high risk for bleeding.
0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 Reliability; Multicores; Fault injection        	Multicore architectures are becoming the most promising computing platforms thanks to their high performance. The soft error rate in multicore systems increases by the trend in the transistor sizes and the reduction of the voltage of the transistors. Evaluating the impact of soft errors on parallel applications is critical to understand the fault characteristics and to decide the fault tolerance strategies for the reliable execution. In this paper, we examine the soft error vulnerabilities of shared data in parallel Java applications. To analyze fault behavior of shared data in parallel programs, we design and implement a bytecode instrumentation based analysis and fault injection framework. We evaluate the fault behavior of shared data fields on a set of parallel applications from NAS benchmark suite. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates data type and access characteristics of the shared fields, and shows that shared data structures of parallel applications are more vulnerable to soft errors. While error rates for unshared local data stay around 20% in our target applications, the rate for shared data exceeds above 30% for some applications. We further discuss potential directions of our results and how shared data analysis can be employed to apply partial fault tolerance techniques. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Participatory culture; communication; social media; CSCW; software engineering        	Software developers use many different communication tools and channels in their work. The diversity of these tools has dramatically increased over the past decade and developers now have access to a wide range of socially enabled communication channels and social media to support their activities. The availability of such social tools is leading to a participatory culture of software development, where developers want to engage with, learn from, and co-create software with other developers. However, the interplay of these social channels, as well as the opportunities and challenges they may create when used together within this participatory development culture are not yet well understood. In this paper, we report on a large-scale survey conducted with 1,449 GitHub users. We discuss the channels these developers find essential to their work and gain an understanding of the challenges they face using them. Our findings lay the empirical foundation for providing recommendations to developers and tool designers on how to use and improve tools for software developers.
5	7	79	Medical 	 Atrial Fibrillation  	 atrial fibrillation; genetics; heart failure; sudden cardiac death        	Purpose of review Atrial fibrillation is an important cause of morbidity in the aging population. The mechanisms responsible for the triggering and maintenance of the chaotic atrial rhythm are still poorly understood. In this review, we will focus on the genetic aspects of atrial fibrillation, to understand causality, with special emphasis on recent studies published in the field. Recent findings Diseases such as hypertension, valvular heart disease, and heart failure may induce atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and sudden cardiac death. Clinical studies published in these last two decades have provided evidence that genetics play a key role in atrial fibrillation. Thus, a family history of the disease has been identified in up to 30% of clinically diagnosed patients. In those genotyped families, most carry rare genetic variants in genes associated with ionic channels, calcium handling protein, or predisposing to fibrosis, conduction system disease, and inflammatory processes. Summary Currently, atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice. The pathophysiological mechanisms of atrial fibrillation are complex. A better understanding of the molecular basis will help improve both current risk stratification and clinical management.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 U3 snoRNA; Guide/ orphan snoRNAs; Entamoeba histolytica        	Background: Small nucleolar RNAs are a highly conserved group of small RNAs found in eukaryotic cells. Genes encoding these RNAs are diversely located throughout the genome. They are functionally conserved, performing post transcriptional modification (methylation and pseudouridylation) of rRNA and other nuclear RNAs. They belong to two major categories: the C/D box and H/ACA box containing snoRNAs. U3 snoRNA is an exceptional member of C/D box snoRNAs and is involved in early processing of pre-rRNA. An antisense sequence is present in each snoRNA which guides the modification or processing of target RNA. However, some snoRNAs lack this sequence and often they are called orphan snoRNAs. Results: We have searched snoRNAs of Entamoeba histolytica from the genome sequence using computational programmes (snoscan and snoSeeker) and we obtained 99 snoRNAs (C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs) along with 5 copies of Eh_U3 snoRNAs. These are located diversely in the genome, mostly in intergenic regions, while some are found in ORFs of protein coding genes, intron and UTRs. The computationally predicted snoRNAs were validated by RT-PCR and northern blotting. The expected sizes were in agreement with the observed sizes for all C/D box snoRNAs tested, while for some of the H/ACA box there was indication of processing to generate shorter products. Conclusion: Our results showed the presence of snoRNAs in E. histolytica, an early branching eukaryote, and the structural features of E. histolytica snoRNAs were well conserved when compared with yeast and human snoRNAs. This study will help in understanding the evolution of these conserved RNAs in diverse phylogenetic groups.

It has been applied to exercise monitoring, gesture recognition, humanmachine interaction, and robot imitation learning. This paper proposes a segmentation framework to categorize and compare different segmentation algorithms considering segment definitions, data sources, application-specific requirements, algorithm mechanics, and validation techniques. The framework is applied to human motion segmentation methods by grouping them into online, semionline, and offline approaches. Among the online approaches, distance-based methods provide the best performance, while stochastic dynamic models work best in the semionline and offline settings. However, most algorithms to date are tested with small datasets, and algorithm generalization across participants and to movement changes remains largely untested.

0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Network security; Botnet detection; DNS analysis; Power spectral density; Group activity        	Domain Name System (DNS) traffic has become a rich source of information from a security perspective. However, the volume of DNS traffic has been skyrocketing, such that security analyzers experience difficulties in collecting, retrieving, and analyzing the DNS traffic in response to modern Internet threats. More precisely, much of the research relating to DNS has been negatively affected by the dramatic increase in the number of queries and domains. This phenomenon has necessitated a scalable approach, which is not dependent on the volume of DNS traffic. In this paper, we introduce a fast and scalable approach, called PsyBoG, for detecting malicious behavior within large volumes of DNS traffic. PsyBoG leverages a signal processing technique, power spectral density (PSD) analysis, to discover the major frequencies resulting from the periodic DNS queries of botnets. The PSD analysis allows us to detect sophisticated botnets regardless of their evasive techniques, sporadic behavior, and even normal users' traffic. Furthermore, our method allows us to deal with large-scale DNS data by only utilizing the timing information of query generation regardless of the number of queries and domains. Finally, PsyBoG discovers groups of hosts which show similar patterns of malicious behavior. PsyBoG was evaluated by conducting experiments with two different data sets, namely DNS traces generated by real maiware in controlled environments and a large number of real-world DNS traces collected from a recursive DNS server, an authoritative DNS server, and Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers. We utilized the maiware traces as the ground truth, and, as a result, PsyBoG performed with a detection accuracy of 95%. By using a large number of DNS traces, we were able to demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of PsyBoG in terms of practical usage. Finally, PsyBoG detected 23 unknown and 26 known botnet groups with 0.1% false positives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
5	52	124	Medical 	 Stress Management  	 coronary artery disease; health behavior; quality of life; risk; self efficacy        	Purpose: The project was to test a structural equation model in which self-efficacy, self-care health behaviors, and modifiable risk factors predict the quality of life (QOL) of individuals with coronary artery disease. Methods: The data set from the intervention study with 130 patients with coronary artery disease before the intervention was included in the secondary analysis for this study. The following parameters were measured: self-efficacy, self-care health behaviors with the subscales of health responsibility, exercise, consumption of a healthy diet, stress management, and smoking cessation; modifiable risk score; and QOL (assessed using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey instrument). Results: The mean age of the participants was 66.1 years. The following evaluation parameters indicated that the proposed model provided a good fit to the data: comparative fit index at .87, goodness of fit index at .91, adjusted goodness of fit index at .84, standardized root mean square residual at .06, root mean square error of estimation at .09, and confidence interval at 0.06-0.13. Self-efficacy, self-care health behaviors, and modifiable risk factors had significant effects on QOL and explained 64.0% of the variance, with modifiable risk factors mediating between self-care health behaviors and QOL. Conclusions: The findings indicate that self-efficacy, self-care health behaviors, and modifiable risk factors play an important role in QOL in adults with coronary artery disease. Patients could be more confident in performing self-care health behaviors, leading to a better QOL, by more effectively managing their cardiovascular risk factors. Nursing strategies to improve QOL in this population should include motivating them to perform self-care health behaviors. Copyright (C) 2016, Korean Society of Nursing Science.

5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 Skin microbiota; Dysbiosis; Contact sport; Wrestlers; Bacillus        	Contact sports athletes often suffer from various skin disorders (inflammatory diseases of bacterial and fungal origin, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, etc.) resulting in long breaks in training which ruin athletic performance. Wrestling implies intense skin-to-skin contact that creates perfect conditions for transmission of the infectious agents. Following the standard rules of hygiene (showering and handwashing directly after each competition and training) does not exclude the possibility to get an infection from sparring partner. To characterize the skin microbial composition of wrestlers who do not have current manifestation of any skin disorders, the metagenomic analysis was performed. Absolute predominance of Bacillus genus in metagenomic profiles of wrestlers' skin was observed in contrast with the existing literature data. Classic microbiological approaches allowed to detect hemolytic forms of microorganisms. Wrestlers' skin appeared to be colonized with hemolytic bacilli, whereas the non-wrestler athletes did not have such bacteria on their skin. Such dysbiotic shifts in the microbial community may cause the emergence of skin diseases. Revealed properties could help to design highly effective antiseptics for the contact sports hygiene.
5	50	122	Medical 	 Sports Injuries  	 ICT; information system; sports; BAN; Cloud architecture; athletes; injuries        	High physical, psychological and economic cost of sports injuries are the reason that lead to the recognition of a need for having a system to monitor health parameters of a professional athlete hence preventing incidences of severe injuries. Athletes in any sports can greatly benefit from feedback from the systems for improving the quality of their training. In this paper, we present architecture for a cloud based system which incorporates wearable motion sensors to obtain information on health parameters of sports athlete and provide feedback to the sports clubs and sports organization in Montenegro. The sensors are placed on athlete's body at predefined positions which may capture the movements, heart rate, ECG and respiratory data. Advances in wireless technology and supporting infrastructure provide opportunity for real-time healthcare and fitness monitoring without constraining the activities of the user. Wirelessly connected sensors placed in, on, and around the body form a body area network for continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of health parameters of professional sports athletes.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Active electrodes; biomedical sensors; double differential electrodes; dry electrodes; surface electromyography        	In this paper we present an analysis of the voltage amplifier needed for double differential (DD) sEMG measurements and a novel, very simple circuit for implementing DD active electrodes. The three-input amplifier that standalone DD active electrodes require is inherently different from a differential amplifier, and general knowledge about its design is scarce in the literature. First, the figures of merit of the amplifier are defined through a decomposition of its input signal into three orthogonal modes. This analysis reveals a mode containing EMG crosstalk components that the DD electrode should reject. Then, the effect of finite input impedance is analyzed. Because there are three terminals, minimum bounds for interference rejection ratios due to electrode and input impedance unbalances with two degrees of freedom are obtained. Finally, a novel circuit design is presented, including only a quadruple operational amplifier and a few passive components. This design is nearly as simple as the branched electrode and much simpler than the three instrumentation amplifier design, while providing robust EMG crosstalk rejection and better input impedance using unity gain buffers for each electrode input. The interference rejection limits of this input stage are analyzed. An easily replicable implementation of the proposed circuit is described, together with a parameter design guideline to adjust it to specific needs. The electrode is compared with the established alternatives, and sample sEMG signals are obtained, acquired on different body locations with dry contacts, successfully rejecting interference sources.
2	0	33	Psychology  	 Prejudice  	 self-interest; immigration; public opinion; political economy; cultural threat        	Research on how economic factors affect attitudes toward immigration often focuses on labor market effects, concluding that, because workers' skill levels do not predict opposition to low- versus highly skilled immigration, economic self-interest does not shape policy attitudes. We conduct a new survey to measure beliefs about a range of economic, political, and cultural consequences of immigration. When economic self-interest is broadened to include concerns about the fiscal burdens created by immigration, beliefs about these economic effects strongly correlate with immigration attitudes and explain a significant share of the difference in support for highly versus low-skilled immigration. Although cultural factors are important, our results suggest that previous work underestimates the importance of economic self-interest as a source of immigration policy preferences and attitudes more generally.
3	8	60	MAE 	 Strength of materials  	 Quaternion; normal stress; shear stress; shear flow        	A quaternion is an ordered combination of four real numbers. It can also be expressed as a sum of a scalar and a vector in three dimensional Euclidian space. Quaternion algebra allows the division of vectors. Since the current vector algebra does not allow the division of vectors; in many branches of mechanics, when a vectoral quantity falls to the denominator of an expression, the general tendency is to use its magnitude rather than its vector character. Once the vector division is defined by the quaternion algebra, it becomes possible to redrive the equations that have vector quantities in their denominators. In this study, basic equations of stress in strength of materials are reviewed according to the rules of quaternion algebra. It is shown that this new point of view brings a more powerful and consistent system. The normal stress becomes a scalar quantity. Area and moment of inertia of a cross-section becomes a vectoral quantity. Direction of shearing stresses change and becomes a more consistent convention especially in torsion problems. The most striking results are obtained in shear flow.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Sublingual immunotherapy; Allergic rhinitis; Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis; Asthma; Dosing        	Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a treatment for allergic respiratory diseases that has demonstrated efficacy and safety. Several formulations of SLIT are now available worldwide for treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). Grass tablets containing 15 to 25 mu g of group 5 major allergen reduced combined AR symptoms and medication use by 23% to 41% in 3 treatment years and 2 follow-up years. Ragweed pollen tablets (12 mg of Ambrosia artemisiifolia 1) and liquid extracts (50 mg of Ambrosia artemisiifolia 1) reduced combined AR symptoms and medication use by 26% and 43%, respectively. House dust mite tablets containing 300 index of reactivity (16 mg of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 and 68 mg of Dermatophagoides farinae 1) reduced AR symptoms by 17.9% and 17.0% in 1 treatment year and 1 follow-up year, respectively. A different house dust mite tablet (12 standardized quality house dust mite) was able to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.96). Most adverse events were local and mild to moderate in severity. For SLIT products reviewed herein, effective doses range from 1.12 to 84 mu g of major allergen(s). However, allergen content is not uniformly standardized, can be expressed in arbitrary or proprietary units (depending on the manufacturer), and assays for determination of allergen content are highly variable. Thus, results from one study of a given product cannot be extrapolated to other products. Despite these limitations, this Clinical Management Review aims to provide practitioners with relevant information on the dosing of selected SLIT formulations in the treatment of allergic respiratory disease.

2	9	42	Psychology  	 Seasonal affective disorder  	 Adjustment disorder; Grief reaction; Complex grief; Seasonal affective disorder; Diagnosis; Treatment        	Seasonal affective disorder is a subtype of other affective disorders. The most studied treatment is light therapy, although second-generation antidepressants are also an option. Grief reactions are normal for patients experiencing loss, and primary care providers (PCPs) should be aware of both the expected course of grief and the more severe symptoms that indicate complex grief. Adjustment disorder is a time-limited abnormal response to a stressor. PCPs can manage patients with adjustment disorder by arranging counseling, screening for suicidality, assessing for substance abuse, and ruling out other psychiatric diagnoses. At present there are no reliable data to suggest medication management.
5	45	117	Medical 	 Psoriasis  	 biomarkers; immunological mechanisms; miRNA; psoriasis        	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, which function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by the dysfunction of keratinocytes, with the immune dysregulation. We reviewed the recent studies on the roles of miRNAs in psoriasis and showed that miRNAs play key roles in psoriasis, including the regulation of hyperproliferation, cytokine and chemokine production in keratinocyte, as well as mediating immune dysfunction in psoriasis. Furthermore, miRNAs, particularly, circulating miRNAs may serve as novel biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring therapy response and reflecting the disease severity. Thus, targeting specific miRNAs may be used to develop new therapeutic methods for psoriasis.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 VAP-1; AOC3; SSAO; bioluminescent assay        	Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), also known as semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) or copper-containing amine oxidase (AOC3, EC 1.4.3.6), catalyzes oxidative deamination of primary amines. One endogenous substrate has recently been described (Siglec 10), and although its mechanism of action in vivo is not completely understood, it is suggested to play a role in immune cell trafficking, making it a target of interest for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Much of the enzymology performed around this target has been conducted with absorbance, fluorescent, or radiometric formats that can have some limitations for high-throughput screening and subsequent compound profiling. The authors present the use of a bioluminescent assay, originally developed for monoamine oxidase enzymes, in a high-throughput format. It can be used for related SSAOs such as AOC1 given their substrate similarity with VAP-1. The authors also demonstrate that it is compatible with different sources of VAP-1, both purified recombinant and VAP-1 overexpressed on live cells.

5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Sport-parenting; Australian football; Parental involvement; Children; Debriefing        	Characteristic issues surrounding parents in youth sport include examples of negative verbal and non-verbal behaviour demonstrated during competition. Numerous studies have done well to highlight while parents possess a great potential for positively influencing the sport experience, they can also exert a considerable negative influence by engaging in a range of non-preferred and inappropriate behaviours. There is certainly a need to further understand the nature of the sport-parenting paradigm given that encouraging and supportive parental involvement is a critical factor in promoting enjoyment and intrinsic motivation among participants. This is particularly important given that children's preferred parental behaviours are temporally dependent. That is, different types of parental involvement are preferred before, during and after competitive sport. However, one aspect of parental involvement in youth sport which has been largely overlooked is the post-game setting. Drawing on qualitative data derived from focus groups and individual interviews with 86 parents and children involved in junior Australian football, this paper reveals an aspect of the sport-parenting role which can further enhance or undermine the youth sport experience. Specifically, it reveals an intriguing insight into the way that parents engage in debriefing' children's performancesrepresenting a challenge for parents who strive to engender a positive and supportive influence in youth sport. While the concept of sport-parenting receives much attention within the competitive setting, this paper argues that in order to enhance the quality of parental involvement in youth sport, much can be learnt from exploring what happens after the game'.
0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 Hypertension; telemedicine and telehealth; remote monitoring        	Background: Hypertension or high blood pressure is on the rise. Not only does it affect the elderly but is also increasingly spreading to younger sectors of the population. Treating this condition involves exhaustive monitoring of patients. The current mobile health services can be improved to perform this task more effectively. Objective: To develop a useful, user-friendly, robust and efficient app, to monitor hypertensive patients and adapted to the particular requirements of hypertension. Methods: This work presents BPcontrol, an Android and iOS app that allows hypertensive patients to communicate with their health-care centers, thus facilitating monitoring and diagnosis. Usability, robustness and efficiency factors for BPcontrol were evaluated for different devices and operating systems (Android, iOS and system-aware). Furthermore, its features were compared with other similar apps in the literature. Results: BPcontrol is robust and user-friendly. The respective start-up efficiency of the Android and iOS versions of BPcontrol were 2.4 and 8.8 times faster than a system-aware app. Similar values were obtained for the communication efficiency (7.25 and 11.75 times faster for the Android and iOS respectively). When comparing plotting performance, BPcontrol was on average 2.25 times faster in the Android case. Most of the apps in the literature have no communication with a server, thus making it impossible to compare their performance with BPcontrol. Conclusions: Its optimal design and the good behavior of its facilities make BPcontrol a very promising mobile app for monitoring hypertensive patients.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Synthetic biology; Synthetic gene networks; Antimicrobial therapeutics; Synthetic probiotics; Bacteriophage; Riboregulator; Toehold switch; Paper-based diagnostics        	The growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance calls for new approaches in the development of antimicrobial therapeutics. Likewise, improved diagnostic measures are essential in guiding the application of targeted therapies and preventing the evolution of therapeutic resistance. Discovery platforms are also needed to form new treatment strategies and identify novel antimicrobial agents. By applying engineering principles to molecular biology, synthetic biologists have developed platforms that improve upon, supplement, and will perhaps supplant traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics. Efforts in engineering bacteriophages and synthetic probiotics demonstrate targeted antimicrobial approaches that can be fine-tuned using synthetic biology-derived principles. Further, the development of paper-based, cell-free expression systems holds promise in promoting the clinical translation of molecular biology tools for diagnostic purposes. In this review, we highlight emerging synthetic biology platform technologies that are geared toward the generation of new antimicrobial therapies, diagnostics, and discovery channels.

5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 Breast cancer; Conserving surgery; Lung cancer; Mastectomy; Radiation therapy        	Introduction: Although the risk factors for lung cancer are well documented, whether previous radiation therapy (RT) to treat breast cancer (BC) increases the incidence of second primary lung cancer remains unclear. We determined the overall incidence of second primary lung cancer after previous RT for all clinical stages of BC. Methods: After an analysis of the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, 986,713 individuals were randomly enrolled from 2000 to 2010 for cohort analysis. All women with newly diagnosed invasive BC, aged 18 years or older, and without other types of malignancy before 2000 or in the follow-up periods were enrolled and allocated to the RT or non-RT groups. Age, comorbidities, insurance premium, urbanization level, location, date of event, and hospital care level were analyzed. The hazard ratios of parameters were calculated by Cox regression analysis. Results: A total of 7408 individuals met the inclusion criteria, including 5695 patients with BC who underwent RT and 128 (2.25%) in whom lung cancer developed. In contrast, lung cancer was diagnosed in only four of 1713 individuals in the non-RT group (0.23%) during the followup period. Cox regression analysis showed that the adjusted hazard ratio was 10.078 times higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. Conclusions: The incidence of second primary lung cancer was significantly higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group for individuals with previous BC. Patients with BC treated by RT should be extensively surveyed to assess the incidence of subsequent lung cancer. (C) 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Denosumab; Osteoporosis; Selection bias; Extension study; FREEDOM        	Background: Denosumab treatment for up to 8 years in the FREEDOM study and Extension was associated with low fracture incidence. It was not clear whether subjects who discontinued during the study conduct had a higher risk of fracture than those who remained enrolled, thereby underestimating the true fracture risk for the entire trial cohort. Thus, we explored the influence of early withdrawals on nonvertebral fracture incidence during the Extension study. Methods: To understand the potential effect of depletion of susceptible subjects on fracture incidence, we first evaluated subject characteristics in patients who were enrolled in the Extension vs those who were not. We subsequently employed a Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation (KMMI) approach to consider subjects who discontinued as if they remained enrolled with a 0%, 20%, 50%, and 100% increase in fracture risk compared with participants remaining on study. Results: Extension enrollees were generally similar to nonparticipants in median age (71.9 and 73.1 years, respectively), mean total hip bone mineral density T-score (-1.9 and -2.0, respectively), and probability of fracture risk by Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX (R)) at FREEDOM baseline (16.9% and 17.7% for major osteoporotic fracture and 6.7% and 7.4% for hip fracture, respectively). When we assumed a doubled fracture risk (100% increase) after discontinuation in KMMI analyses, nonvertebral fracture rate estimates were only marginally higher than the observed rates for both the crossover group (10.32% vs 9.16%, respectively) and the long-term group (7.63% vs 6.63%, respectively). Conclusion: The observation of continued denosumab efficacy over 8 years of treatment was robust and does not seem to be explained by depletion of susceptible subjects.
0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 Queueing; redundant requests; scheduling        	Reducing latency in distributed computing and data storage systems is gaining increasing importance. Several empirical works have reported on the efficacy of scheduling redundant requests in such systems. That is, one may reduce job latency by: 1) scheduling the same job at more than one server and 2) waiting only until the fastest of them responds. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the power of using redundant requests, and all of the existing results rely heavily on a common assumption: all redundant requests of a job can be immediately cancelled as soon as one of them is completed. We study how one should schedule redundant requests when such assumption does not hold. This is of great importance in practice, since cancellation of running jobs typically incurs non-negligible delays. In order to bridge the gap between the existing models and practice, we propose a new queueing model that captures such cancellation delays. We then find how one can schedule redundant requests to achieve the optimal average job latency under the new model. Our results show that even with a small cancellation overhead, the actual optimal scheduling policy differs significantly from the optimal scheduling policy when the overhead is zero. Furthermore, we study optimal dynamic scheduling policies, which appropriately schedule redundant requests based on the number of jobs in the system. Our analysis reveals that for the two-server case, the optimal dynamic scheduler can achieve 7%-16% lower average job latency, compared with the optimal static scheduler.
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 genetic diversity; endemic plant; gene flow; ornamental shrub; microsatellite markers; populations; contraction        	Michelia yunnanensis Franch., is a traditional ornamental, aromatic, and medicinal shrub that endemic to Yunnan Province in southwest China. Although the species has a large distribution pattern and is abundant in Yunnan Province, the populations are dramatically declining because of overexploitation and habitat destruction. Studies on the genetic variation and demography of endemic species are necessary to develop effective conservation and management strategies. To generate such knowledge, we used 3 pairs of universal cpDNA markers and 10 pairs of microsatellite markers to assess the genetic diversity, genetic structure, and demographic history of 7 M. yunnanensis populations. We calculated a total of 88 alleles for 10 polymorphic loci and 10 haplotypes for a combined 2,089 bp of cpDNA. M. yunnanensis populations showed high genetic diversity (Ho = 0.551 for nuclear markers and Hd = 0.471 for cpDNA markers) and low genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.058). Geographical structure was not found among M. yunnanensis populations. Genetic distance and geographic distance were not correlated (P >0.05), which indicated that geographic isolation is not the primary cause of the low genetic differentiation of M. yunnanensis. Additionally, M. yunnanensis populations contracted similar to 20,000-30,000 years ago, and no recent expansion occurred in current populations. Results indicated that the high genetic diversity of the species and within its populations holds promise for effective genetic resource management and sustainable utilization. Thus, we suggest that the conservation and management of M. yunnanensis should address exotic overexploitation and habitat destruction.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 Combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system; Operating strategy; Hybrid electric-thermal (HET) following method; Natural gas; Solar energy        	A hybrid electric-thermal (HET) following method is proposed for a combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system driven by natural gas and solar energy, focusing on the supply matching of domestic hot water, space cooling/heating and electricity. The domestic hot water thermal demand (Class A) is set to be met preferentially due to its immediateness and timeliness, and the space cooling/heating (Class B) thermal demand matching condition will be discussed from the view of comfort reliability. Detailed strategy methods under summer and winter conditions are presented. Variable electric-thermal ratio (RA, the ratio of the thermal demand of domestic hot water to the electric demand, RE, the ratio of the thermal demand of space cooling/heating to the electric demand) load conditions are analyzed and a comparison of HET between the base following electric load and following thermal load strategies is discussed for hotel applications. The criteria including primary energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, operation cost and exergy efficiency is employed to evaluate the performances in the HET strategy. The results indicate that HET can achieve more benefits than the base operation strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	5	77	Medical 	 Asthma  	 transient receptor potential vanilloid 4; ion channels; asthma; pulmonary vascular disease; acute respiratory distress syndrome        	Ion channels/pumps are essential regulators of organ homeostasis and disease. In the present review, we discuss the role of the mechanosensitive cation channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), in cytokine secretion and pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). TRPV4 has been shown to play a role in lung diseases associated with lung parenchymal stretch or stiffness. TRPV4 indirectly mediates hypotonicity-induced smooth muscle contraction and airway remodeling in asthma. Further, the literature suggests that in CF TRPV4 may improve ciliary beat frequency enhancing mucociliary clearance, while at the same time increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion/lung tissue injury. Currently it is understood that the role of TRPV4 in immune cell function and associated lung tissue injury/ARDS may depend on the injury stimulus. Uncovering the downstream mechanisms of TRPV4 action in pulmonary inflammatory diseases is likely important to understanding disease pathogenesis and may lead to novel therapeutics.
5	49	121	Medical 	 Smoking Cessation  	 behavioral economics; HIV; medication adherence; Uganda        	Objective: Fixed incentives have been largely unsuccessful in improving adherence to antiretroviral medication. Therefore, we evaluate whether small incentives based on behavioral economic theory can increase adherence to antiretroviral medication among treatment-mature adults in Kampala, Uganda. Design: A randomized control trial design tests whether providing small incentives based on either attending timely clinic visits (intervention group 1) or achieving high medication adherence (intervention group 2) can increase antiretroviral adherence. Antiretroviral adherence is measured by medical event monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Methods: Overall, 155 HIV-infected men and women age 19-78 were randomized into one of two intervention groups and received small prizes of US $ 1.50 awarded through a drawing conditional on either attending scheduled clinic appointments or achieving at least 90% antiretroviral adherence. The control group received the usual standard of care. Results: Preliminary results based on pooling the intervention groups showed individuals receiving incentives were 23.7 percentage points more likely to achieve 90% antiretroviral adherence compared with the control group [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.7-40.7%]. Specifically, 63.3% (95% CI, 52.9-72.8%) of participants in the pooled intervention groups maintained at least 90% mean adherence during the first 9 months of the intervention, compared with 39.6% (95% CI, 25.8-54.7%) in the control group. Conclusion: Small prize incentives resulted in a statistically significant increase in antiretroviral adherence. Although more traditional fixed incentives have not produced the desired results, these findings suggest that small incentives based on behavioral economic theory may be more effective in motivating long-term adherence among treatment-mature adults.

1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 COD removal; Sulphate removal; Sulphur recovery; Microbial fuel cell; Wastewater treatment        	Varying chemical oxygen demand (COD) and sulphate concentrations in substrate were used to determine reaction kinetics and mass balance of organic matter and sulphate transformation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFC with anodic chamber volume of 1 L, fed with wastewater having COD of 500 mg/L and sulphate of 200 mg/L, could harvest power of 54.4 mW/m(2), at a Coulombic efficiency of 14%, with respective COD and sulphate removals of 90 and 95%. Sulphide concentration, even up to 1500 mg/L, did not inhibit anodic biochemical reactions, due to instantaneous abiotic oxidation to sulphur, at high inlet sulphate. Experiments on abiotic oxidation of sulphide to sulphur revealed maximum oxidation taking place at an anodic potential of -200 mV. More than 99% sulphate removal could be achieved in a MFC with inlet COD/sulphate of 0.75, giving around 1.33 kg/m(3) day COD removal. Bioelectrochemical conversion of sulphate facilitating sulphur recovery in a MFC makes it an interesting pollution abatement technique.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 women; aging; aerobic exercise; endothelium-dependent dilation        	Aging causes micro-and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction, as assessed by endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), which can be prevented and reversed by habitual aerobic exercise (AE) in men. However, in estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, whole forearm microvascular EDD has not been studied, and a beneficial effect of AE on macrovascular EDD has not been consistently shown. We assessed forearm blood flow in response to brachial artery infusions of acetylcholine (FBFACh), a measure of whole forearm microvascular EDD, and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of macrovascular EDD, in 12 premenopausal sedentary women (Pre-S; 24 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max)= 37.5 +/- 1.6 ml.kg (-1).min(-1)), 25 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal sedentary women (Post-S; 62 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max) +/- 24.7 +/- 0.9 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)), and 16 estrogen-deficient postmenopausal AE-trained women (Post-AE; 59 +/- 1 yr; (V) over dot(O2max) +/- 40.4 +/- 1.4 ml.kg(-1)min(-1)). FBFACh was lower in Post-S and Post-AE compared with Pre-S women (135 +/- 9 and 116 +/- 17 vs. 193 +/- 21 AUC, respectively, both P < 0.008), whereas Post-S and Post-AE women were not different (P = 0.3). Brachial artery FMD was 34% (5.73 +/- 0.67%) and 45% (4.79 +/- 0.57%) lower in Post-S and Post-AE, respectively, vs. Pre-S women (8.69 +/- 0.95%, both P <= 0.01), but not different between Post-S and Post-AE women (P = 0.3). Post-AE women had lower circulating C-reactive protein and oxidized low-density lipoprotein compared with Post-S women (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/l and 40 +/- 4 vs. 55 +/- 3 U/l, respectively, both P = 0.01), but these markers were not correlated to FBFACh (P = 0.3) or brachial artery FMD (P = 0.8). These findings are consistent with the idea that habitual AE does not protect against age/menopause-related whole forearm micro-and macrovascular endothelial dysfunction in healthy nonobese estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, despite being associated with lower systemic markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to demonstrate that habitual aerobic exercise may not protect against age/menopauserelated whole forearm microvascular endothelial dysfunction in healthy nonobese estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women, consistent with recent findings regarding macrovascular endothelial function. This is in contrast to what is observed in healthy middle-aged and older aerobic exercise-trained men.
1	14	31	ECE 	 PID controller  	 non-contact excitation; electromagnetic exciter; journal bearing; finite element analysis        	A non-contact type force actuator is necessary for studying the dynamic performance of a high-speed spindle system owing to its high-speed operating conditions. A non-contact electromagnetic exciter is designed for identifying the dynamic coefficients of journal bearings in high-speed grinding spindles. A linear force control method is developed based on PID controller. The influence of amplitude and frequency of current, misalignment and rotational speed on magnetic field and excitation force is investigated based on two-dimensional finite element analysis. The electromagnetic excitation force is measured with the auxiliary coils and calibrated by load cells. The design is validated by the experimental results. Theoretical and experimental investigations show that the proposed design can accurately generate linear excitation force with sufficiently large amplitude and higher signal to noise ratio. Moreover, the fluctuations in force amplitude are reduced to a greater extent with the designed linear control method even when the air gap changes due to the rotor vibration at high-speed conditions. Besides, it is possible to apply various types of excitations: constant, synchronous, and non-synchronous excitation forces based on the proposed linear control method. This exciter can be used as linear-force exciting and controlling system for dynamic performance study of different high-speed rotor-bearing systems.

Due to the increasing number of RPGSs connected to the utility grid, power quality, safe operation, and islanding protection of RPGSs are becoming important issues, among others. One of the most important elements is the current control technique that must meet the requirements for grid interconnection according to international standards and practices. The RPGS itself must be safe and highly efficient for reliable and secure grid interconnection operations. This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art of the current control techniques for three-phase grid-interconnection of RPGSs. Several current control architectures, their operations including advantages and disadvantages were discussed. Performance comparison and evaluation of several controllers were also reviewed.

2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 NON-HEGEMONIC GENDER ROLES AND SEXUALITIES; SILENCE; ART; TRANSDUCTION; PERFORMANCE        	Marginalisation of people in non-hegemonic/non-normative gender roles and sexualities is often discussed in terms of their 'silencing'. Silence tends to occupy liminal stages of communication and interaction, it is well suited to indexing marginalised subjectivities. However, this paper argues that in the context of artistic performance, that is where silence is displayed rather than imposed, it can be revalued as affirming and liberating. Art, which thrives on equivocality and understatement, tends to be silence-friendly due to its affordances of relative indeterminacy and ambiguity. Several examples of transduction of silence in modern and contemporary art illustrate how art embraces, rather than obscures or disavows, male and female homosexual identities and non-heroic masculinities. The works examined include Robert Rauschenberg's and Agnes Martin's monochromes, New York Dada drawings and photographs, and activist HIV/AIDS installations and photographs.
2	9	42	Psychology  	 Seasonal affective disorder  	 circadian; dopamine; electroretinogram; photoperiod; retina; vision        	Visual system development depends on neural activity, driven by intrinsic and light-sensitive mechanisms. Here, we examined the effects on retinal function due to exposure to summer-and winter-like circadian light cycles during development and adulthood. Retinal light responses, visual behaviors, dopamine content, retinal morphology, and gene expression were assessed in mice reared in seasonal photoperiods consisting of light/dark cycles of 8: 16, 16: 8, and 12: 12 h, respectively. Mice exposed to short, winter-like, light cycles showed enduring deficits in photopic retinal light responses and visual contrast sensitivity, but only transient changes were observed for scotopic measures. Dopamine levels were significantly lower in short photoperiod mice, and dopaminergic agonist treatment rescued the photopic light response deficits. Tyrosine hydroxylase and Early Growth Response factor-1 mRNA expression were reduced in short photoperiod retinas. Therefore, seasonal light cycles experienced during retinal development and maturation have lasting influence on retinal and visual function, likely through developmental programming of retinal dopamine.

The aim of the device was to establish an in-shoe measurement system with high resolution and to take relatively accurate measurements. The calibration method for the smart material was established with the use of a Kistler force plate. The coefficient of determination r(2) of the force against resistance calibration curve was 0.974. The residual standard deviation amounted to 13.91 N. The r(2) value of the repetitive loading experiments amounted to 0.981. The residual standard deviation was 70.35 N for forces larger than 700 N. From the data obtained, the insole is deemed to be sufficiently accurate for quantitative analysis. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Parenting intervention; Externalizing behavior; Self-efficacy beliefs; Emotion coaching practices        	This research compared the efficacy of two parenting interventions that vary according to the number and the nature of variables in reducing preschoolers' externalizing behavior (EB). The goal was to identify which parenting intervention format (one-variable versus two-variable) caused higher behavioral adjustment in children. The first was a one-variable intervention manipulating parental self-efficacy beliefs. The second was a two-variable intervention manipulating both parents' self-efficacy beliefs and emotion coaching practices. The two interventions shared exactly the same design, consisting of eight parent group sessions. Effect on children's EB and observed behaviors were evaluated through a multi-method assessment at three points (pre-test, post-test and follow-up). The results highlighted that compared to the waitlist condition, the two intervention formats tended to cause a significant reduction in children's EB reported by their parent. However, the one-variable intervention was found to lead to a greater decrease in children's EB at follow-up. The opposite was reported for children's observed behavior, which was improved to a greater extent in the two-variable intervention at post-test and follow-up. The results illustrated that interventions' format cannot be considered as purely interchangeable since their impact on children's behavior modification is different. The results are discussed for their research and clinical implications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Participants were randomized into conditions that either provided additional rewards for substance abstinence and/or health-promoting/prosocial behaviors (""CM-full""; n = 64) or for study compliance and attendance only (""CM-lite""; n = 67). The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine the affect of ASPD status on two primary study outcomes: methamphetamine abstinence, and engagement in prosocial/health-promoting behavior. Analyses revealed that individuals with ASPD provided more methamphetamine-negative urine samples (37.5%) than participants without ASPD (30.6%). When controlling for participant sociodemographics and condition assignment, the magnitude of this predicted difference increases to 10% and reached statistical significance (p < .05). On average, participants with ASPD earned fewer vouchers for health-promoting/prosocial behaviors than participants without ASPD ($10.21 [SD = $7.02] versus $18.38 [SD = $13.60]; p < .01). Participants with ASPD displayed superior methamphetamine abstinence outcomes regardless of CM schedule; even with potentially unlimited positive reinforcement, individuals with ASPD displayed suboptimal outcomes in achieving health-promoting/prosocial behaviors.

The estimation of mean values of fibrils diameter, length and bending stiffness on micrographs is a major challenge. For this purpose we developed an open-source Fibril) plugin for the ImageJ/FiJi program. It automatically recognizes the fibrils on the surface of a mica, silicon, gold or formvar film and further analyzes them to calculate the distribution of fibrils by diameters, lengths and persistence lengths. The plugin has been validated by the processing of TEM images of fibrils formed by Sup35NM yeast protein and artificially created images of rod-shape objects with predefined parameters. Novel data obtained by SEM for Sup35NM protein fibrils immobilized on silicon and gold substrates are also presented and analyzed. Program summary Program title: FibrilJ Program Files doi: http://dx.doLorg/10.17632/ndxb93h4vc.1 Licensing provisions: Apache-2.0 Programming language: ImageJ Macro Language Nature of problem: Amyloids are large protein aggregates that form Unbranched fibrils. Formation of amyloids by different proteins leads to the emergence of a number of serious human diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Therefore, various amyloids, in particular their topology, are widely studied in an enormous number of papers. The structural organization of the amyloid aggregates at the molecular level is a key problem in this area. At the moment new methods of amyloids analysis based on electronic and probe microscopy are particularly popular. Usually it is required to process images containing hundreds of amyloids to obtain statistically reliable data on the distribution of the thickness, length and persistence length (a basic mechanical property quantifying the stiffness of a polymer). The lattermost parameter was introduced for the chatkteristic of bending stiffness of amyloids similarly to that in a model of wormlike chain for polymers. The manual measurements of these parameters take a lot of time and, due to the human factor, are insufficiently representative. ImageJ/FiJi is open-source software and one of the most commonly used program for image processing. The ImageJ/FiJi community provides BoneJ plugin for bones analysis and Diameter! plugin for nanofibers analysis, which have the function of determining the diameter of the respective objects. Also, approaches that involve calculations of the end-to-end distances and contour lengths of biopolymers were used to determine their persistence lengths using ImageJ/FiJi. These above mentioned plugins are not designed for the study of amyloids and have never been used or validated for them. They do not provide the necessary functionality for the automatic recognition of amyloids on the substrate and filtering objects by a number of parameters. They have unspecified accuracy of these objects measurements and do not calculate the objects distribution on average diameters and persistence lengths. Solution method: For this purpose we developed a Fibril! plugin for ImageJ/FiJi program With an open source code. It automatically recognizes the fibrils on the surface of a mica, silicon, gold or formvar film and further analyzes them to calculate the distribution of fibrils on average diameters, lengths and persistence lengths. FibrilJ usage may unify the process of diameter and persistence length calculation and it may also contribute to comparison of results obtained by different research groups. Plugin Fibril) which is presentedin this paper is free of Diameter) or BoneJ weaknesses. It has been validated by artificially created images of rod-shape objects with predefined parameters and micrographs of Sup35NM protein fibrils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 hyporheic exchange; floodplain connectivity; riparian zone; overbank flooding hydraulics; preferential flow; stream restoration        	Restoring hydrologic connectivity between channels and floodplains is common practice in stream and river restoration. Floodplain hydrology and hydrogeology impact stream hydraulics, ecology, biogeochemical processing, and pollutant removal, yet rigorous field evaluations of surface water-groundwater exchange within floodplains during overbank floods are rare. We conducted five sets of experimental floods to mimic floodplain reconnection by pumping stream water onto an existing floodplain swale. Floods were conducted throughout the year to capture seasonal variation and each involved two replicate floods on successive days to test the effect of varying antecedent moisture. Water levels and specific conductance were measured in surface water, soil, and groundwater within the floodplain, along with surface flow into and out of the floodplain. Vegetation density varied seasonally and controlled the volume of surface water storage on the floodplain. By contrast, antecedent moisture conditions controlled storage of water in floodplain soils, with drier antecedent moisture conditions leading to increased subsurface storage and slower flood wave propagation across the floodplain surface. The site experienced spatial heterogeneity in vertical connectivity between surface water and groundwater across the floodplain surface, where propagation of hydrostatic pressure, preferential flow, and bulk Darcy flow were all mechanisms that may have occurred during the five floods. Vertical connectivity also increased with time, suggesting higher frequency of floodplain inundation may increase surface water-groundwater exchange across the floodplain surface. Understanding the variability of floodplain impacts on water quality noted in the literature likely requires better accounting for seasonal variations in floodplain vegetation and antecedent moisture as well as heterogeneous exchange flow mechanisms.

6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 Cancer stem cells; Microenvironment; Stem cell-microenvironment interactions; Neoplastic stem cell biology; Cell interactions        	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined by their unlimited self-renewal ability and their capacity to initiate and maintain malignancy, traits that are not found in most cells that comprise the tumor. Although current cancer treatments successfully reduce tumor burden, the tumor will likely recur unless CSCs are effectively eradicated. This challenge is made greater by the protective impact of the tumor microenvironment (TME), consisting of infiltrating immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix, and signaling molecules. The TME acts as a therapeutic barrier through immunosuppressive, and thereby tumor-promoting, actions. These factors, outside of the cancer cell lineage, work in concert to shelter CSCs from both the body's intrinsic anticancer immunity and pharmaceutical interventions to maintain cancer growth. Emerging therapies aimed at the TME offer a promising new tool in breaking through this shield to target the CSCs, yet definitive treatments remain unrealized. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which CSCs are protected by the TME and current efforts to overcome these barriers. Stem Cells2017;35:1123-1130
5	29	101	Medical 	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome  	 cytokines; IL-10; inflammation; inflammatory bowel disease; therapy        	Purpose: Pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines are important modulators of the immune response and play a major role in conditions of intestinal inflammation, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Cytokine production is regulated genetically, and imbalances in cytokine secretion may affect disease susceptibility and clinical outcomes of various conditions. There is a rapidly growing body of evidence to support an etiologic role for gastrointestinal infection and the associated immune activation in the development of postinfectious IBS. Other factors such as psychological stress, anxiety, and depression may likely be involved in the altered profiles of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines that lead to chronic IBS. Methods: We searched the literature using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar with related key terms and prepared this review article on that basis. Findings: Interleukin (IL)-10 is a regulatory cytokine that inhibits both antigen presentation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, it is proposed as a potent antiinflammatory biological therapy for IBS. Implications: Recently, a strong interest in the therapeutic potential of IL-10 for IBS has developed. The diverse roles of IL-10 in IBS are reviewed here. We conducted an in-depth review on IL-10 and IBS to address this question. Future studies of IL-10 may provide new insights into IBS therapy.

0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 Bebras contest; computational thinking; informatics concepts; informatics education; categorization; databases        	Computational thinking is an increasingly important focus in computer science or informatics curricula around the world, and ways of incorporating it into the school curricula are being sought. The Bebras contest on informatics, which originated 12 years ago and now involves around 50 countries, consists of short problem-solving tasks based on topics in informatics. Bebras tasks engender the development of computational thinking skills by incorporating abstraction, algorithmic thinking, decomposition, evaluation and generalization. Bebras tasks cover a range of informatics concepts including algorithms and data structures, programming, networking, databases and social and ethical issues. Having built up a substantial number of Bebras tasks over 12 years it is important to be able to categorize them so that they can be easily accessed by the Bebras community and teachers within schools. The categorization of tasks within Bebras is important as it ensures that tasks span a wide range of topics; there have been several categorization schemes suggested to date. In this paper we present a new two-dimensional categorization system that takes account of computational thinking skills as well as content knowledge. Examples are given from recent tasks that illustrate the role that Bebras can play in the development of computational thinking skills.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Sinusoidal oscillators; Wien-bridge oscillators; Multivibrators        	This paper shows that a Wien-bridge oscillator is not always a sinusoidal oscillator. Depending on the differential input voltage of the operational amplifier used, the output of the Wien-bridge oscillator can move from a nearly sinusoidal wave to a nearly square wave. This depends largely on the values of the passive components used. Experimental results that confirms the presented theory are included. These results confirm the previously made observations that sinusoidal oscillators and multivibrators are not separate classes of circuits as the same circuit can provide the two modes of operation depending on the values of the passive components used.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Atopy; avulsion; immunology; inflammation; replantation; root resorption        	Introduction: The goal of replantation after dental avulsion is to maintain the tooth in its socket. Presence of vital periodontal ligament cells on the root surface of the replanted tooth and the immunologic status of the patient are factors that protect against root resorption. It is known that dental constituents play an active role in root resorption by inducing specific and non-specific immune responses; however, little information exists regarding the influence of the acquired immune response on replantation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 5-year outcome of replantation in non-atopic and atopic patients. Methods: Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed in 62 replanted teeth during a 5-year period. The evaluation of atopy was based on the patients' personal and family histories and skin prick test results. The X-2 and the Z tests were used to assess the association between atopy and the outcome of the replanted teeth (P < .05). Results: There were significant differences between the 1-year and 5-year outcomes of the replanted teeth (P < .05) and atopic and non-atopic patients who had their teeth extracted because of inflammatory or replacement root resorption after 5 years (P < .05). Conclusions: Being atopic may offer the advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of replacement resorption, whereas being non-atopic may create an advantage of loss of fewer teeth because of inflammatory root resorption during the first 5 years after trauma.
5	19	91	Medical 	 Mental Health  	 Self-harm; Harm reduction; Inpatient; Crisis care; Mental health nursing        	Background: Harm reduction has had positive outcomes for people using sexual health and substance misuse services. Clinical guidance recommends these approaches may be appropriately adopted by mental health practitioners when managing some people who self-harm. There has, however, been very little research in this area. Methods: We explored practitioners' views of harm reduction as a strategy for supporting people who self harm. The Self Harm Antipathy Scale (SHAS) was administered to a random sample of 395 mental health practitioners working on 31 wards in England, semi-structured interviews were then conducted with 18 survey respondents. Results: Practitioners who had implemented the approach reported positive outcomes including a reduction in incidence and severity of self-harm and a perceived increase in empowerment of service users. Practitioners with no experience of using harm reduction were concerned that self-harm would increase in severity, and were unsure how to assess and manage risk in people under a harm reduction care plan. Some fundamentally disagreed with the principle of harm reduction for self-harm because it challenged their core beliefs about the morality of self-harm, or the ethical and potential legal ramifications of allowing individuals to harm themselves. Limitations: This study was conducted solely with practitioners working on inpatient units. The majority of staff interviewed had no experience of harm reduction and so their concerns may not reflect challenges encountered by practitioners in clinical practice. Conclusions: Harm reduction is being used to support people who self-harm within inpatient psychiatry and some practitioners report potential benefits of this approach. However, this raises particularly complex practical, ethical and legal issues and further research is needed to assess the safety, acceptability and efficacy of the approach.

Previous research indicates that HDACs play an essential regulatory role in the development of various immune cells. However, the specific function of individual HDACs remains largely unexplored. HDAC4, a member of class II HDACs, profoundly investigated in the nervous system, while the expression profile and function of HDAC4 in T cells are barely known. For the first time, we report here that HDAC4 is expressed in the multiple T cell lineages. Using T-cell-specific HDAC4-deficient mice, we discovered that lack of HDAC4 did not alter the frequencies of conventional T cells, invariant NKT (iNKT) cells or regulatory T cells within both the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs. Moreover, conventional T cells and iNKT cells from wild-type and HDAC4-deficient mice displayed no significant difference in cytokine production. In conclusion, our results imply that under steady stage, HDAC4 is not required for the development and function of multiple T cell lineages, including conventional T cells and iNKT cells.
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 Structural value; Geosynthetics; Geotextile; Falling Weight deflectometer; Non-destructive test; Hot mix asphalt        	The use of geotextiles to postpone reflective cracks in asphalt overlay is a popular practice, so researchers are eager to calculate its structural value. This research study has focused on this issue for geotextiles used in the roads of Iran. Twelve sections from the Tehran-Qom road were tested; each examined before and after construction of the overlay. The tests were of the Falling Weight Deflectometer type, and at least twelve tests were conducted each time. The data from five sections (four for developing the model and one for evaluating the output) allowed a new mathematical model to be developed. For the seven remaining sections, some foreign and Iranian geotextiles were used as interlayers. The mean structural value for all of the geotextiles was equivalent to that of a 2.92 cm-thick Hot Mix Asphalt overlay, while that for only the Iranian sections was equivalent to 2.28 cm. Economic evaluations, based on construction costs, showed that in 2011 the use of geotextiles was economical in Iran, because fuel and bitumen subsidies had been eliminated and different geotextile brands had been brought to market in the country.
6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 cell mechanics; cell water dynamics; cytoskeleton mechanics        	Under the microscope, eukaryotic animal cells can adopt a variety of different shapes and sizes. These cells also move and deform, and the physical mechanisms driving these movements and shape changes are important in fundamental cell biology, tissue mechanics, as well as disease biology. This article reviews some of the basic mechanical concepts in cells, emphasizing continuum mechanics description of cytoskeletal networks and hydrodynamic flows across the cell membrane. We discuss how cells can generate movement and shape changes by controlling mass fluxes at the cell boundary. These mass fluxes can come from polymerization/depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton, as well as osmotic and hydraulic pressure-driven flow of water across the cell membrane. By combining hydraulic pressure control with force balance conditions at the cell surface, we discuss a quantitative mechanism of cell shape and volume control. The broad consequences of this model on cell mechanosensation and tissue mechanics are outlined.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 KCNJ11; permanent diabetes mellitus; 6q24; transient neonatal diabetes mellitus        	Although hyperglycemia is common in neonates, especially preterm infants, a diagnosis of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is rarely made. NDM can be permanent (45%), transient (45%) or syndromic (10%). Of the 95% of identifiable mutations for NDM, methylation defects in 6q24, KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS account for the majority. Two cases of transient NDM in extremely preterm, 24 weeks' gestational age (GA) triplets, due to a missense mutation c.685G>A in the KCNJ11 gene are presented. Both patients were successfully transitioned from insulin to Glyburide (Glibenclamide) at 2 months of age. Comprehensive genetic testing with targeted next-generation sequencing and 6q24 methylation analysis helps identify monogenic diabetes early, thereby improving metabolic and glycemic control when patients with potassium channel mutations are started on sulfonylurea (SU) treatment.
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Water conservation and pollution control; Performance evaluation; Process level; Textile production technology        	Industrial manufacturers are required to adopt water conservation and pollution control technologies because of increasingly serious water scarcity and water pollution, especially in textile industry. An effective performance evaluation tool for these technologies is greatly needed for textile manufacturers. However, the existing tools for textile industry can only evaluate on plant level and ignore pollution effect of water consumption. In order to help textile manufacturers know about water conservation and pollution control performance of technologies more systematically and comprehensively, we developed a process-level water conservation and pollution control performance evaluation tool of cleaner production technology in textile industry. The new tool includes three indicators: water withdrawal reduction, water consumption reduction and water assimilation reduction. Comparison between the new tool and old ones by evaluating the low-pollution-concentration effluent reuse technology in a polyester flannel fabric dyeing and printing plant demonstrates that the new tool can help textile manufacturers to not only understand operation mechanism of a technology on specific processes and then take specific improvement measures on different processes to optimize water conservation and pollution control performance, but also find out indiscoverable disadvantages of a technology and then adopt complementary technologies to reduce negative effect of the technology.

2	16	49	Psychology  	 False memories  	 Stereotype threat; Ageing; Memory; Memory errors; Regulatory focus        	Stereotype threat often incurs the cost of reducing the amount of information that older adults accurately recall. In the current research, we tested whether stereotype threat can also benefit memory. According to the regulatory focus account of stereotype threat, threat induces a prevention focus in which people become concerned with avoiding errors of commission and are sensitive to the presence or absence of losses within their environment. Because of this, we predicted that stereotype threat might reduce older adults' memory errors. Results were consistent with this prediction. Older adults under stereotype threat had lower intrusion rates during free-recall tests (Experiments 1 and 2). They also reduced their false alarms and adopted more conservative response criteria during a recognition test (Experiment 2). Thus, stereotype threat can decrease older adults' false memories, albeit at the cost of fewer veridical memories, as well.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 Rainwater harvesting; Greywater reuse; Water reuse; Water consumption indices; Restroom auditing; Water management        	The main issues related to water conservation in urban centers are the increase in water supply cost, demand growth, pollution and differences in the distribution of water resources. Water conservation, the controlled and efficient use of water, includes both measures as reasonable means of water reuse. Thus, conservation practices are an effective way to meet demand and supply water to new activities and users without jeopardizing the supplying water bodies and preserving the natural environment. This study aims to examine the water management of a shopping mall, the use of rainwater harvesting combined with greywater reuse, to investigate the feasibility of these water reuse systems. For buildings in general, water loss is common due to leaks in the hydraulic and restroom equipment. These losses, which are caused by a high volume of water used and wasted in the system, are often the result of design errors, incorrect maintenance procedures and users' bad habits. In southern Brazil, where there is an abundance of rainwater, water shortages occasionally occur, particularly in the winter. One difficulty that appears on rainwater studies is the proper determination of rainwater volume that can be used to address water supply systems. In this work, the simulation method was used to determine this volume. Thus, simulations with the following variables: rainfall, catchment area and water consumption were performed. For mall's hydraulic systems, segmented alternatives are adopted. That is, focusing on the use of rainwater or greywater reuse. Other alternatives are underutilized due to sanitary issues, those are water from toilets and kitchen sinks. The adoption of greywater may be feasible if there is a significant flow of greywater to comply water demand for toilet flushing. The inspections made in this study found that the quantity of sinks was insufficient to supply an adequate amount of water to toilets and urinals. The greywater reuse system was found to be infeasible. Conversely, the rainwater harvesting system was entirely feasible and easily supplied water to all restrooms and contributed to the cooling of the air conditioning system with a short payback period. One of the challenges of this work was the need to compare the actual water consumption with a water consumption parameter used in buildings. Thus, a method that addresses the generation of specific consumption indexes for specific activity (like a mall) was used. The water consumption indices showed that this mall has a satisfactory water management program. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
4	2	63	Civil 	 Remote Sensing  	 Biophysical remote sensing; Vegetation indices; Spectral indices; NDVI; Field spectroscopy; Hyperion; WorldView-3        	In this study, we investigated the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing data for estimating green percent vegetation cover (PVC) for a study site in the Canadian High Arctic. A field experiment was conducted on Sabine Peninsula (76 degrees 27' N, 108 degrees 33' W), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada to collect field spectra and PVC for five vegetation types, i.e., polar semi-desert (PD), dry mesic tundra (DMT), mesic tundra (MT), wet mesic tundra (WMT) and wet sedge/moss (WSM). Based on field spectra, two types of 2-band hyperspectral (i.e., Hyperion) and multi spectral (i.e., WorldView-3) vegetation indices (VIs) were derived using all possible band combinations. Optimal spectral bands were identified based on their correlations with green PVC. In addition, VIs designed for other landscapes were examined for their ability to estimate green PVC in an Arctic environment. The results indicate that PVC and spectral features for Arctic vegetation types were related to moisture content: (1) vegetation types with dry to intermediate soil moisture (e.g., PD, DMT and MT) possessed large amounts of bare soil and exhibited spectral properties similar to bare soil; and (2) vegetation types with high moisture content (e.g., WMT and WSM) exhibited spectra similar to senescent vegetation given the substantial proportion of senescent vegetation in these vegetation types. The optimal Hyperion spectral bands for estimating green PVC were located at the absorption features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including 681.20 nm (leaf pigment absorption); 721.90 nm and 732.07 nm (along the red-edge slope); 1174.77 nm and 1184.87 nm (leaf water absorption); and 1447.14 nm, 1457.23 nm, 2072.65 nm and 2102.94 nm (leaf cellulose and lignin absorption). Narrowband Vls exhibited a stronger correlation with green PVC than broadband Vls due to the finer spectral features sampled by hyperspectral data. Further, VIs designed to estimate leaf pigment and dry matter content (e.g., lignin and cellulose) showed strong correlations with green PVC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 mda-7; receptor; hepatocellular carcinoma; apoptosis        	BACKGROUND: The mda-7/IL-24 receptor belongs to the type 11 cytokine receptor family, and its two heterodimeric receptors are IL-22R1/IL-20R2 and IL-20R1/IL-20R2. Mda-7/IL-24 receptor expression in liver cancer cell lines has not yet been described. This information may be helpful for further clinical gene therapy. METHODS: With normal skin total RNA as template, the cDNA sequences of IL-20R1, IL-20R2 and IL-22R were amplified by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cultured liver cancer cell lines and a normal liver cell line, then detected by northern blotting, and the expression of mda-7/IL-24 receptors was analyzed. RESULTS: PLC/PRF/5 and SMMC-7721 expressed IL-20R1; BEL-7402, Hep3B, HepG2, and PLC/PRF/5 expressed IL20R2; and HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 expressed IL-22R. Only HepG2 expressed the IL-22R/IL-20R2 receptor complex. PLC/PRF/5 completely expressed both heterodimeric receptors. Huh-7, QGY-7701 and WRL-68 did not express the IL-24 receptor. CONCLUSION: Complete mda-7/IL-24 receptors are seldom expressed in liver cancer cell lines.
3	1	53	MAE 	 Hydraulics  	 aquaporin; cell elongation; growth-induced water potential deficit; growth regulation; hydraulic conductance; secondary active water transport        	Current concepts of growth hydraulics in higher plants are critically revisited, and it is concluded that they partly fail to interpret the experimental data adequately, particularly in the case of hydroponics-grown roots. Theoretical considerations indicate that the growth rate in roots is controlled by the extensibility of the cell wall, excluding water availability (i.e. hydraulic conductance) as a major constraint. This is supported by the findings that the growth rate does not scale with turgor, and that no radial nor axial water potential gradients have been observed in the root elongation zone. Nevertheless, a water potential deficit ranging from -0.2 to -0.6 MPa has repeatedly been reported for growing cells that by far exceeds the shallow trans-membrane water potential difference required for the uptake of growth water. Unexpectedly, growth was also shown to depend on the hydraulic conductance (LP) of the plasma membrane of root cells, even though LP should generally be too large to have an impact on growth. For leaves, similar observations have been reported, but the interpretation of the data is less straightforward. Inconsistencies associated with the current model of growth hydraulics prompt the author to suggest a revised model that comprises, in addition to a passive mechanism of water transport across the plasma membrane of growing cells mediated by aquaporins ('leak') a secondary active water transport ('pump'), in analogy to a mechanism previously demonstrated for mammalian epithelia and postulated for xylem parenchyma cells in roots. Water is hypothesised to be secreted against a trans-membrane water potential difference by cotransport with solutes (salts, sugars, and/or amino acids), taking advantage of the free energy released by this transport step. The solute concentration gradient is supposed to be maintained by a subsequent retrieval of the solutes from the apoplast and back-transport at the expense of metabolic energy. Water secretion tends to reduce the turgor pressure and retards growth, but turgor and, in turn, growth can be upregulated very rapidly independent from any adjustment in the osmolyte deposition rate by increasing LP and/or reducing secondary active water transport, e.g. when the root is exposed to mild osmotic stress, as confirmed by experimental studies.
6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 Osteoprotegerin; Genetic polymorphisms; Ischemic stroke; Microembolic signals; NHISS; Vascular stenosis        	Background and purpose: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and is involved in the progress of atherosclerosis. We chose a gene polymorphism locus, OPG rs3102735, to explore how OPG gene polymorphisms relate to the occurrence of ischemic stroke and microembolic signals and to evaluate their relationship with the severity of neurologic deficits at admission and the degree of vascular stenosis. Methods: We studied 251 patients diagnosed with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke and 121 controls. The LAA stroke patients were divided into clinical subgroups according to the presence of microembolic signals, severity of neurologic deficits at admission, and the degree of vascular stenosis. The OPG rs3102735 gene polymorphism was examined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The microembolic signals (MES) were monitored by transcranial Doppler (TCD) for 60 min within 72 h of stroke onset. The severity of neurologic deficits at admission was evaluated by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Results: The CC + CT genotypes and allele C frequencies of the rs3102735 gene polymorphism were significantly higher in the LAA group than in the control group (39% vs. 25.6%, P = 0.026; 21.7% vs.13.2%, P = 0.006), higher in MES-positive compared to MES-negative patients (58.7% vs. 32.4%, P < 0.01; 34.1% vs.17.6%, P= 6) than in those with an NIHSS Score (0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the OPG rs3102735 gene polymorphism might be related to the occurrence of LAA ischemic stroke, microembolic signals and stroke severity and not the degree of vascular stenosis.

4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Wastewater management policy; Life cycle assessment; Environmental impact; Wastewater treatment optimization        	In recent decades, China has been facing serious water pollution crises. To address this problem, discharge standards for wastewater treatment plants in China are becoming more and more stringent. Also, the sewage charge for compliant emissions and the penalty rate for non-compliant emissions have increased significantly. This paper comprehensively investigates the economic and environmental implications of such wastewater management policy in China. In this paper, a general framework for the analysis of WWTPs' behavior and the resulted economic and environmental consequences is presented, and the impacts of discharge standard, charge rate, and penalty rate are analyzed. The trade-offs-between the operational cost, environmental impact, and pollutant emissions are identified. This study also provides some insightful management implications for concerned policy makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 Operating costs; calculation; green buildings; monitoring costs of administrative building        	The current trend of green buildings is reflected in the construction of administration buildings and of residential complexes. There is a non-profit organization Czech Green Building Council in the Czech Republic, which integrates different companies linked to economics to transform the current method of construction for green energy and healthier building. On the one side stands the cost of the green building, but on the other hand, there stand operating costs of the life cycle of the buildings and they have considerable influence in deciding of investor. The aim of the paper is monitoring operating costs with respect to initial costs of green buildings. The assessed environmentally friendly building are the new administrative building, the renovated administrative building and the administrative building built on the traditional method of construction. There is clearly presents differences in operating costs of monitored buildings in the paper. Operating costs are conversion to m3 of enclosed space and the number of people using facilities.. The article surveys the innovative approach of facility management into the development process of green buildings. The results presented are based on calculations and actually achieved values.
4	10	71	Civil 	 Smart Material  	 dynamic test; entangled metallic wire material; metal rubber; mechanical properties; magnetic        	This work describes the dynamic characteristics of a novel soft magnetic entangled metallic wire material(SM-EMWM) by the dynamic tests for the first time. The mechanical properties of three batches of SM-EMWMs with different porosities have been investigated under different dynamic loads in different magnetic field intensities. The result shows that its properties (storage modulus and loss factor) have commendably controllable magnetic responses in the magnetic field. In particular, the dynamic damping is more remarkable than its quasi-static performance, and the loss factor can be improved above 50% in the magnetic field of 500 mT. The results indicate that SM-EMWM as a magneto-sensitive smart material possesses a considerable application prospect for the active vibration control with variable stiffness and damping.
3	7	59	MAE 	 Materials Engineering  	 Ceramics; Microstructure; Sintering        	In the present work, high-frequency induction heating was firstly used to densify TiB2-SiC ceramic, and the microstructure analysis indicated that the average grain size of the sample, which was sintered through induction heating, was smaller than that of the sample sintered through hot-pressing. The flexural strength and fracture toughness were improved after refining the grains and increasing the relative density. In order to characterize the densification behavior of TiB2-SiC ceramic sintered through induction heating, the typical curve of measured linear shrinkage of a sample was calculated and used. The tangential and normal grinding forces were substituted by the horizontal and vertical forces measured from the dynamometer in order to characterize intuitively the effect of grinding parameters on the microstructure and residual stress. The above-mentioned results revealed that the high-frequency induction heating has more advantages over hot-pressing. The results and way of these works can be applied to aid materials engineering design for the development of new materials, quality assurance, and characterization assessment of durability.

5	35	107	Medical 	 Migraine  	 Sexual dysfunction; Multiple sclerosis; Migraine; Depression; Quality of life        	"Sexuality is an integral part of overall health but the impact of neurological diseases on sexual function still receives too little attention. The aim of this case control study was to compare frequencies and characteristics of sexual dysfunction in women with stable relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and migraine. Sexually active women aged 18-50 years were recruited at the MS and headache outpatient clinics of a university hospital and asked to complete questionnaires on sexual function using the multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire (MSISQ-19) adapted for patients with migraine, depression using the Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) and quality of life using the short form-36 questionnaire (SF-36). At least one symptom of sexual dysfunction was ""almost always"" or ""always"" present in 35.7 % of 42 patients with MS and in 22.6 % of 30 patients with migraine (p = 0.3). The MSISQ-19 total score did not differ between the two groups (31.6 +/- 10.8 vs. 28.2 +/- 11.6, respectively, p = 0.2). Sexual dysfunction was categorized as primary, secondary and tertiary in 66.7 %, 40 % and 33.3 % of MS patients and in 57.1 % (p = 0.7), 71.4 % (p = 0.2) and 71.4 % (p = 0.1) of migraine patients, respectively. Depressive symptoms were more common in women with sexual dysfunction than in those without both in MS (p = 0.001) and migraine (p = 0.006). The SF-36 showed decreasing quality of life with increasing MSISQ-19 sum scores (mental subscale p < 0.001 and physical subscale p = 0.04). Sexual dysfunction is a major problem both in women with MS and in women with migraine and is strongly associated with comorbid depression and impaired quality of life. Thus, categorizing sexuality as done by MSISQ-19 is limited by its complex biopsychosocial interactions."
6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 atherosclerosis; genetics; HDL; PDZK1; SR-B1        	Purpose of review To outline the roles of SR-B1 and PDZK1 in hepatic selective HDL cholesterol uptake and reverse cholesterol transport and the consequences for atherosclerosis development. Recent findings Much of our understanding of the physiological roles of SR-B1 and PDZK1 in HDL metabolism and atherosclerosis comes from studies of genetically manipulated mice. These show SR-B1 and PDZK1 play key roles in HDL metabolism and protection against atherosclerosis. The recent identification of rare loss of function mutations in the human SCARB1 gene verifies that it plays similar roles in HDL metabolism in humans. Other rare mutations in both the human SCARB1 and PDZK1 genes remain to be characterized but may have potentially devastating consequences to SR-B1 function. Summary Identification of carriers of rare mutations in human SCARB1 and PDZK1 that impair the function of their gene products and characterization of the effects of these mutations on HDL cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis will add to our understanding of the importance of HDL function and cholesterol flux, as opposed to HDL-cholesterol levels, per se, for protection against cardiovascular disease.
5	21	93	Medical 	 Headache  	 Sleep; Circadian rhythm; Mood states; Anxiety; Melatonin hormone        	The melatonin as the pineal gland's secretory product is implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Melatonin has critical functions in human physiology, and research underscores the importance of melatonin in circadian rhythm, sleep, and mood regulation. Clinical observations have indicated that migraine attacks have a seasonal, menstrual, and circadian timing, suggesting that chronobiological mechanisms and their alterations may causally involve in the etiology of the disease. However, the topic has received relatively little attention in the migraine literature. Associations between melatonin, circadian preference, sleep, and mood states were investigated in the current study. Fifty-five patients (47 females and 8 males) were compared to 57 gender and age-matched control subjects (40 females and 17 males). A socio-demographical questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire were administered to volunteers. Blood samples were taken from all participants at about 1:00 AM in an unlit room not to hamper melatonin secretion, and blood melatonin levels were measured using quantitative ELISA test. In comparison with controls, melatonin levels were significantly lower among migraine patients. Migraineurs reported significantly greater scores on the BAI, confusion-bewilderment subscale of the POMS, and total and sleep latency subscale of the PSQI. Migraine patients who had nausea during the migraine attacks and who reported bouts relevant to certain food consumption, such as cheese or chocolate, had significantly lower levels of melatonin. Contrarily, groups did not reveal statistically substantial difference in circadian preferences.
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 Geosynthetics; Cyclic loading; Shear strength; Shear testing; Sandbags; Coastal protection        	Friction properties at geotextile interfaces play an important role in the stability of geotextile encapsulated-sand systems in coastal protection. The stabilising action of the frictional force is important to oppose sliding along the contact surface and to prevent deformations, which may lead to structural failures. This paper presents a set of experiments, based on large-scale direct shear tests performed under both cyclic loading and cyclic displacement conditions, examining friction at interfaces between geotextile specimens, sand-filled geosystem elements, and between a sand layer and a sand-filled geosystem element. The results presented here indicate that the friction parameters (i.e., shear strength and friction angle) derived from geotextile specimens are below those obtained for sand-filled elements, which suggests that using the former for the stability analysis is conservative. The tests carried out with a sand layer surface showed that a modification to the shear plane slope is likely to occur for the sand-filled geosystem element buries into the sand layer. This deformation can result in toe instability, ultimately leading to progressive damage or even collapse of the entire structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Microtextured regions; Macrozones; Titanium; Cloud computing; ICME; MGI; Material informatics; Higher-order statistics        	With the fast global adoption of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), scientists and engineers are faced with the need to conduct sophisticated data analytics on large datasets to extract knowledge that can be used in modeling the behavior of materials. This raises a new problem for materials scientists: how to create and foster interoperability and share developed software tools and generated datasets. A microstructure-informed cloud-based platform (MiCloud (TM)) has been developed that addresses this need, enabling users to easily access and insert microstructure informatics into computational tools that predict performance of engineering products by accounting for microstructural dependencies on manufacturing provenance. The platform extracts information from microstructure data by employing algorithms including signal processing, machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, predictive analytics, uncertainty quantification, and data visualization. The interoperability capabilities of MiCloud and its various web-based applications are demonstrated in this case study by analyzing Ti6AlV4 microstructure data via automatic identification of various features of interest and quantifying its characteristics that are used in extracting correlations and causations for the associated mechanical behavior (e.g., yield strength, cold-dwell debit, etc.). The data were recorded by two methods: (1) backscattered electron (BSE) imaging for extracting spatial and morphological information about alpha and beta phases and (2) electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for extracting spatial, crystallographic, and morphological information about microtextured regions (MTRs) of the alpha phase. Extracting reliable knowledge from generated information requires data analytics of a large amount of multiscale microstructure data which necessitates the development of efficient algorithms (and the associated software tools) for data recording, analysis, and visualization. The interoperability of these tools and superior effectiveness of the cloud computing approach are validated by featuring several examples of its use in alpha/beta titanium alloys and Ni-based superalloys, reflecting the anticipated computational cost and time savings via the use of web-based applications in implementations of microstructure-informed integrated computational materials engineering (ICME).
0	3	3	CS 	 Cryptography  	 Mobile cloud computing; Efficient handover process; Service-oriented architecture; Energy detection; Secure and Strong authentication priority enforcement module        	Mobile cloud computing uses features to deliver outsourcing data to remotely available mobile devices. However, the flexible nature of the mobile device is a critical challenge for the mobile cloud computing environment. The mobile phone significantly degrades the data transfer performance when initiating the handover process. Thus, an energy-efficient handover process could improve the quality of service (QoS). Here, we introduce a secure energy-efficient and quality-of-service architecture (EEQoSA) for the handover process in the mobile cloud computing environment. The proposed architecture involves four layers: application, the Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IPMS), communication, and media with connectivity layers. These four layers collectively handle the energy-efficiency, security and QoS parameters. Existing service-oriented architectures designed for mobile cloud computing are based on the symmetric encryption cryptography to support different media services. However, this approach easily allows an adversary to expose the symmetric key and gain access to private data. Thus, our proposed architecture uses the secure and strong authentication (SSA) process at the IPMS layer by protecting the media services from unauthorized users, as the IPMS is the central layer that could be the entry point for an adversary. Furthermore, to extend the mobile lifetime during the handover process, an energy detection (ED) model is deployed at the communication layer to detect the energy level of the mobile device prior to the handover initialization process. The media with the connectivity layer supports the secure handover process using a priority enforcement module that allows only legitimate users to complete the re-registration process after initiating the handover. Finally, the architecture is tested using the CloudSim simulation environment and validated by a comparison with other known service-oriented architectures.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 video games; social play; reciprocity; prosocial behavior; challenge        	As an entertainment technology, video games are a popular social activity that can allow for multiple players to cooperatively engage on-screen challenges. Emerging research has found that when people play together, the resulting teamwork can have beneficial impacts on their prosocial orientations after gameplay - especially when the players are cooperative with one another. The present study wanted to expand the scope of these beneficial interpersonal effects by considering both inter- and intrapersonal factors. In an experimental study (N = 115) we manipulated the difficulty of a game (easy or hard) and the behavior of a confederate teammate (supportive or unsupportive playing style). We found that neither coplayer supportiveness nor game difficulty had an effect on the expectations of a teammate's prosocial behavior or one's own prosocial behavior toward the teammate after the game (operationalized as willingness to share small amounts of money with one's teammate after playing). Increased expectations of prosocial behavior from one's teammate were related to one's own prosocial behaviors, independent of our manipulations. Considering these results, we propose alternative theoretical approaches to understanding complex social interactions in video games. Furthermore, we suggest to explore other types of manipulations of game difficulty and cooperation between video game players as well as alternative measures of prosocial behavior.
2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Childhood trauma; Abuse; Grey matter; Hippocampus; Amygdala; Voxel based morphometry; Pdsychiatric diagnosis        	Childhood trauma has been associated with long term effects on prefrontal-limbic grey matter. A literature search was conducted to identify structural magnetic resonance imaging studies of adults with a history of childhood trauma. We performed three meta-analyses. Hedges' g effect sizes were calculated for each study providing hippocampal or amygdala volumes of trauma and non-trauma groups. Seed based differential mapping was utilised to synthesise whole brain voxel based morphometry(VBM) studies. A total of 38 articles (17 hippocampus, 13 amygdala, 19 whole brain VBM) were included in the meta-analyses. Trauma cohorts exhibited smaller hippocampus and amygdala volumes bilaterally. The most robust findings of the whole brain VBM meta-analysis were reduced grey matter in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right hippocampus amongst adults with a history of childhood trauma. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions showed results were moderated by age, gender, the cohort's psychiatric health and the study's definition of childhood trauma. We provide evidence of abnormal grey matter in prefrontal-limbic brain regions of adults with a history of childhood maltreatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 mucosal healing; refractory Crohn's disease; thalidomide        	Background: Thalidomide is effective in inducing and maintaining clinical remission in children and adolescents with refractory Crohn's disease (CD). However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of thalidomide for adult patients with CD. Methods: We conducted a prospective open-label cohort study between January 2013 and April 2015. A total of 47 adult patients with active CD who were dependent/resistant or intolerant to corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators or biologics received 50-100 mg of thalidomide daily. Primary outcome was clinical remission evaluated at week 8. Endoscopic assessment was performed at week 24 and defined as endoscopic response (decrease in Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity [CDEIS] score >5 points from baseline CDEIS of 6 or more), complete endoscopic remission (CDEIS score < 3), and mucosal healing (MH) (no ulceration). Results: A total of 47 adults with active CD were enrolled. The clinical remission rate was 14.9% and 23.4% at week 4 and week 8, but increased to 46.8% at week 12 and 53.2% at week 24 out of all the 47 patients included (intention-to-treat analysis). Altogether 32 patients consented and underwent ileocolonoscopy at week 24. The rate of endoscopic response and complete endoscopic remission were 68.4% and 43.8%. MH (no ulceration) was achieved in 28.1% of patients. Adverse events occurred in 27/47 (57.4%) patients but necessitated therapy discontinuation in only 5/47 (10.6%) of patients. Conclusions: Low-dose thalidomide was effective and tolerated for inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with active CD, but the optimal time frame for thalidomide to induce clinical remission may be longer than previously appreciated and is probably optimal at 12 weeks. MH could reasonably be achievable with thalidomide.
5	43	115	Medical 	 Parkinson's Disease  	 Animal models; behaviour (rodent); brain recovery; focal ischemia; immunohistochemistry; stroke; MCAO        	In order to test therapeutics, functional assessments are required. In pre-clinical stroke research, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate behavioural tasks to assess deficits, especially when testing over extended times in milder models with short occlusion times and small lesion volumes. In this study, we comprehensively assessed 16 different behavioural tests, with the aim of identifying those that show robust, reliable and stable deficits for up to two months. These tasks are regularly used in stroke research, as well as being useful for examining striatal dysfunction in models of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Two cohorts of male Wistar rats underwent the intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (30min) and were imaged 24h later. This resulted in primarily subcortical infarcts, with a small amount of cortical damage. Animals were tested, along with sham and naive groups at 24h, seven days, and one and two months. Following behavioural testing, brains were processed and striatal neuronal counts were performed alongside measurements of total brain and white matter atrophy. The staircase, adjusting steps, rotarod and apomorphine-induced rotations were the most reliable for assessing long-term deficits in the 30min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke.
1	10	27	ECE 	 Satellite radio  	 Multiband antennas; small frequency ratio; vehicular telematics        	A single-layer pentaband antenna with very small frequency ratio for urban vehicular communication application has been presented. The proposed antenna is linearly polarized and is designed to cover the navigation and communication frequencies. This antenna utilizes a square patch radiator loaded with an inverted U-slot and a coupled C-slot to provide resonance at the navigation frequencies-viz., 1.176, 1.381, and 1.575 GHz-and communication frequencies-viz., Satellite Radio Broadcast Service (SRBS) at 1.472 GHz and Mobile services at 1.675 GHz. The designed antenna exhibits the lowest frequency ratio of 1:1.17:1. 25:1.35:1.43 with nonoverlapping frequency bands. Furthermore, a parametric study has been carried out to investigate the effect caused by the change in slot parameters in the antenna aperture. Both theoretical and experimental results have been presented and discussed.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 dissipative energy loss; echocardiography; end-stage renal disease; vector flow mapping        	Objectives-Dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping represents the viscous dissipation of turbulent blood flow. We aimed to determine the left ventricular (LV) energy loss in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Methods-Patients with ESRD and a preserved LV ejection fraction, who consisted of a group receiving peritoneal dialysis, a group receiving hemodialysis, and a group receiving preparation for dialysis initiation, were examined by echocardiography; a group of healthy control participants were examined as well. Vector flow mapping analysis was then performed from the apical 4-chamber view to calculate the energy loss during diastole and systole in the left ventricle. Results-Conventional transthoracic echocardiography and LV energy loss calculations were successfully performed in 63 cases and 50 controls. The patients with ESRD had significantly higher diastolic energy loss [median (interquartile range), 71.73 (46.08-106.75) versus 23.32 (17.17-29.26) mW/m; P < .001] and higher systolic energy loss [25.28 (19.03-33.93) versus 12.52 (9.35-16.47) mW/m; P < .001]. A significant difference in diastolic energy loss between the peritoneal dialysis and preparation groups was found [54.92 (39.28-89.94) versus 84.82 (62.58-171.4) mW/m; P = .04]. In patients with ESRD, the log-transformed diastolic energy loss had a significant association with the peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (P=.011), peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity-to-peak early diastolic mitral annular flow velocity ratio (P = .001), LV mass index (P = .017), and heart rate (P = .003). Conclusions-Impaired blood flow efficiency was detected in patients with ESRD by using dissipative energy loss derived from vector flow mapping. The energy loss value could be a novel parameter for evaluating the ventricular workload of uremic hearts in terms of fluid mechanics.
2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Entrepreneurship; Social Representation; Diaspora        	The Algarve region, focus of this analysis, is a place of multiculturalism, being chosen by many foreigners, that go there on vacation and end up moving to this region of Portugal, especially to engage with business. The easiness in communication and the facilities in returning to their home countries (just a few hours by plane) are pointed out as the main reasons for them to settle in the Algarve Region. According to the obtained indicators, most of Algarve's migrant communities are British, Dutch, French, and from other European countries. There is, also, a community of entrepreneurial women that in the diaspora bet in this region, which is another side to the issue of migration still little explored academically. However, we acknowledged that the presence of British and Europeans in Algarve's ecosystem is a long-standing reality, prior to the Treaty of Constitution for the European Union in Portugal signed in 1985. Our analysis specifically concerns the female migrants who develop their entrepreneurial activities in the region. The data revealed that they are women of middle and upper-middle class. Thus, it arises the need to reflect on their contribution and on how they boost the economy and the development of the Algarve. We used as methodology the consultation and comparison demographic available, as well as the empirical contact with key entities in the region. Looking back at this thematic collection we intend to relate gender roles, which have been strongly stigmatized by the man's identity or woman's identity, to the idea of entrepreneurism. In assessing the economic development needs of a country and the growing demand for entrepreneurial activities, we considered that the woman in the role of entrepreneur has been less explored, because of the various cultural and social reasons, what is a potential waste.
5	10	82	Medical 	 Bipolar Disorder  	 Mental disorder; Sex life; Maternity; Family planning; High-risk behavior; Turkey        	This descriptive and cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the specific factors that influence the sex lives of psychiatric patients. The study sample consisted of patients who received care in the psychiatry department of a university hospital (N = 200). Data were collected using a questionnaire developed according to information available in the literature and the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale. The mean age of the patients in the study was 36.70 +/- 10.34 years. Additionally, 58% (n = 116) of the patients were female, and 42% (n = 84) were male. The diagnostic composition of the sample was 25% of patients with schizophrenia, 25% with bipolar disorder, 25% with depression, and 25% with anxiety disorder. More than half of the patients (57.5%) expressed that they had a reduced sex drive compared to their predisease condition, and 39% of the patients claimed that their treatment contributed to their reduced sexual drive. Moreover, 30.5% of the patients expressed that they had no knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases. Utilizing the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale, sexual dysfunction was observed in 74% (n = 144) of the patients. The incidence of sexual dysfunction in people diagnosed with schizophrenia was found to besignificantly higher than that of the patients in other diagnosis groups (p = h0, 002**).
5	21	93	Medical 	 Headache  	 Cluster headache; oxygen treatment; mask types; randomized controlled trial        	Purpose: The purpose of this article is to investigate possible differences in effect between three types of masks in the acute treatment of cluster headache (CH). Patients and methods: Fifty-seven CH patients according to ICHD-II-criteria participated in a single-blinded, semirandomized, placebo-controlled, crossover inpatient study, and 102 CH attacks were treated with 100% oxygen delivered by demand valve oxygen (DVO), O2ptimask or simple mask (15 liters/min) or placebo delivered by DVO for 15 minutes. Primary endpoint: Two-point decrease of pain on a five-point rating scale within 15 minutes. Results: Only 10 CH patients had multiple attacks and reached the point of placebo. There were no significant differences between masks in the primary endpoints (p = 0.412). After 15 minutes 48% had a two-point decrease using the DVO compared to 45% with placebo (p = 0.867). After 30 minutes 68% were pain free or had pain relief using DVO and 45% by placebo (p = 0.061). The DVO was preferred by 62% compared to 5% and 33% for simple mask (p< 0.0001) and O(2)ptimask (p = 0.061). In the first attack the DVO was significantly better at achieving pain relief at 15 minutes (p = 0.018). Treatment with DVO or O(2)ptimask reduced the need for rescue medication compared to the simple mask (23%, 19%, 50%, respectively). No treatment-related adverse events were observed. Conclusion: The primary endpoint with pain relief at 15 minutes was non-significant; however, a post hoc analysis of the first attack significantly favored DVO. Further, therapy by O(2)ptimask and DVO resulted in a decreased need for rescue medication. We recommend that CH patients be offered DVO or O(2)ptimask before oxygen therapy is abandoned.
5	10	82	Medical 	 Bipolar Disorder  	 Curcumin; turmeric; neuropsychiatric disorders; psychiatric; review        	Turmeric has been used in traditional medicine for centuries to treat a range of ailments. Its primary active constituent curcumin, can influence an array of biological activities. Many of these, such as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, and monoaminergic effects are dysregulated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In this systematic review, in vitro, animal, and human studies investigating the potential of curcumin as a treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders, and autism are reviewed, and directions for future research are proposed. It is concluded that curcumin is a promising, natural agent for many of these conditions, however, further research utilising robust, clinical designs are essential. The problem associated with the poor oral bioavailability of standard curcumin also requires consideration. Currently the greatest support for the efficacy of curcumin is for the treatment of major depressive disorder.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; Affective disorders; Cardiac autonomic control; Cardiorespiratory coupling        	Background: Several studies have demonstrated that adjuvant therapies as exercise and breathing training are effective in improving cardiac autonomic control (CAC) in patients with affective spectrum disorders. However, the effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) on autonomic function in this population is unknown. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that SKY training improves CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling in patients with anxiety and/or depression disorders. Methods: Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of anxiety and/or depression disorders (DSM-IV) were consecutively enrolled and divided in two groups: 1) conventional therapy (Control) and 2) conventional therapy associated with SKY (Treatment) for 15 days. Anxiety and depression levels were determined using quantitative questionnaires. For the assessment of CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling, cardiorespiratory traces were analyzed using monovariate and bivariate autoregressive spectral analysis, respectively. Results: After 15-days, we observed a reduction of anxiety and depression levels only in Treatment group. Moreover, sympathetic modulation and CAC were significantly lower while parasympathetic modulation and cardiorespiratory coupling were significantly higher in the Treatment compared to Control group. Conclusions: Intensive breathing training using SKY approach improves anxiety and/or depressive disorders as well as CAC and cardiorespiratory coupling. These finding suggest that the SKY training may be a useful non pharmacological intervention to improve symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with anxiety/ depression disorders.
1	11	28	ECE 	 Control engineering  	 Fuzzy logic; thermostat; thermal comfort; actual mean vote; air conditioning        	This paper presents the fieldwork and the control system studies to examine and improve the thermal comfort of the occupants in a typical office building in Malaysia. The proposed control system works as the basis of adjusting the thermostat setting at a certain period of time with the degree of using the fuzzy logic. The thermostat of the central AC system has its set point fixed between 21? and 22?, slightly below the range of 23-26? as recommended by Malaysian Standard MS1525. In order to maintain the room comfort, the occupants choose to switch OFF the central AC system for a certain period of time before it is switched back ON. It has been repeated at least once per working days. Therefore, the proposed control system is designed to overcome this practice. Pre- and post-comfort surveys have been conducted where the thermal comfort level of the occupants throughout this study is investigated. The air temperature (T-a), globe temperature (T-g), air velocity (V) and relative humidity (RH) in the occupied area were data-logged for continuous five working days. These data are used to compute the operative temperature (T-op) before new thermostat set points are generated, which indicates possible adjustment from the recommended set-point (24?). The proposed thermostat setting has an error tolerance of 2.9% or less. As a result, the simulation results show an adjustment of the thermostat setting from 24? to 25.5?, which successfully maintained the room temperature of the main office between 23.3? and 25?. The relative humidity is maintained between 54.3% and 59.8%. Also, these outcomes have indirectly promoted an average increase of 22.6% in the thermal comfort satisfactory level of the occupants. Practical application: The new conclusions from the simplified thermostat control strategy, which can be customised according to the environment variables in the air-conditioned space (in this case the operative temperature and the relative humidity) or based on the preferences of the occupants, such as the level of thermal comfort that suits the current thermal environment in tropical climates, could be applied as an important guide for building services engineers and researchers. Their aims are to reduce energy usage in HVAC systems in the non-green office buildings in tropical climates while maintaining an adequate thermal comfort level, and thus, the performance and well-being of the office workers are improved.

Two modelling approaches are elaborated. In the first one the stator armatures of the DSIM are described by two coupled circuits in Concordia's frame. In the second approach the stator armatures of the DSIM are described by two decoupled circuits. One is equivalent to the model of three phase machine in Concordia's frame. And the other is equivalent to a passive circuit and does not produce torque. Based on the established electrical circuits, the effect of supply mode and the increasing of the inverter level on the current quality and the torque ripples are analyzed.
1	2	19	ECE 	 Electrical circuits  	 Morphological operations; histogram analysis; super-component        	An electrical or an electronic circuit often contains special combinations of circuit symbols in the form of sub-circuits. Identification and analysis of these sub-circuits can substantially simplify the underlying topology of a circuit. This paper explains our maiden attempt towards topological simplification of a circuit by identifying two important classes of sub-circuits-one formed by symbols connected in series and another by symbols connected in parallel. Although a sub-circuit is usually formed with the same type of circuit symbols, our method can handle any combination, irrespective of the symbol types. The method, in general, is based on a novel histogram analysis, mathematical morphology, and geometric features during the symbol identification phase, and a set of adjacency lists representing the connectivity matrix during the analysis phase. The idea may be extended to match topologically similar but spatially different circuits using graph isomorphism. It may also be used for vectorization of circuit drawings utilizing the information on the segmented circuit elements and their connectivity matrices. We have tested the proposed method on a dataset containing 83 scanned images of a variety of electronic and electrical drawings. Some of the results are presented here to demonstrate its efficacy and robustness.
1	15	32	ECE 	 Operational amplifier  	 Current mode circuits; Operational floating current conveyor; Current conveyor; Instrumentation; Operational amplifier; Balanced amplifiers        	This paper presents a new current mode implementation of a balanced-output-signal generator that utilizes an operational floating current conveyor (OFCC) as a basic building block. The OFCC, as a current-mode device, shows flexible properties with respect to other current or voltage-mode circuits. The advantages of the proposed current mode balanced-output-signal generator (CMBG) are threefold. Firstly, it offers an accurate phase and amplitude performance over a wide bandwidth without requiring matched resistors. Secondly, it has a differential input and it can provide either current or voltage outputs. Finally, the proposed CMBG circuit offers a significant improvement in accuracy compared to other CMBGs based on the current conveyor. The proposed CMBG has been analyzed, simulated and experimentally tested. The experimental results verify that the proposed CMBG outperforms existing CMBGs in terms of the number of basic building blocks used and accuracy.

MCTD was proposed as a distinct disease. However, soon after the original description, questions about the existence of such a syndrome as well as disputes over the features initially described began to surface. The conundrum of whether MCTD is a distinct disease entity remains controversial. We undertook a literature review, focusing on the articles reporting new data about MCTD published in the last decade, to determine whether any new observations help to answer the conundrum of MCTD. After reviewing recent data, we question whether the term MCTD is appropriately retained, preferring to use the term undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic disease.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians develop a working knowledge of contraception to help adolescents reduce risks of and negative health consequences related to unintended pregnancy. Over the past 10 years, a number of new contraceptive methods have become available to adolescents, newer guidance has been issued on existing contraceptive methods, and the evidence base for contraception for special populations (adolescents who have disabilities, are obese, are recipients of solid organ transplants, or are HIV infected) has expanded. The Academy has addressed contraception since 1980, and this policy statement updates the 2007 statement on contraception and adolescents. It provides the pediatrician with a description and rationale for best practices in counseling and prescribing contraception for adolescents. It is supported by an accompanying technical report.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 recombinant horseradish peroxidase; site-saturation mutagenesis; glycosylation site; protein stability; H2O2 inactivation        	Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with a variety of potential biotechnological applications is still isolated from the horseradish root as a mixture of different isoenzymes with different biochemical properties. There is an increasing demand for preparations of high amounts of pure enzyme but its recombinant production is limited because of the lack of glycosylation in Escherichia coli and different glycosylation patterns in yeasts which affects its stability parameters. The goal of this study was to increase the stability of non-glycosylated enzyme, which is produced in E. coli, toward hydrogen peroxide via mutagenesis. Asparagine 268, one of the N-glycosylation sites of the enzyme, has been mutated via saturation mutagenesis using the megaprimer method. Modification and miniaturization of previously described protocols enabled screening of a library propagated in E. coli XJb (DE3). The library of mutants was screened for stability toward hydrogen peroxide with azinobis (ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as a reducing substrate. Asn268Gly mutant, the top variant from the screening, exhibited 18-fold increased stability toward hydrogen peroxide and twice improved thermal stability compared with the recombinant HRP. Moreover, the substitution led to 2.5-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency with phenol/4-aminoantipyrine. Constructed mutant represents a stable biocatalyst, which may find use in medical diagnostics, biosensing, and bioprocesses. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 Cell Biology; Chaperone; Heat shock; Label free; QconCAT; S; cerevisiae; Selected reaction monitoring        	Chaperones are fundamental to regulating the heat shock response, mediating protein recovery from thermal-induced misfolding and aggregation. Using the QconCAT strategy and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for absolute protein quantification, we have determined copy per cell values for 49 key chaperones in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions of normal growth and heat shock. This work extends a previous chemostat quantification study by including up to five Q-peptides per protein to improve confidence in protein quantification. In contrast to the global proteome profile of S. cerevisiae in response to heat shock, which remains largely unchanged as determined by label-free quantification, many of the chaperones are upregulated with an average two-fold increase in protein abundance. Interestingly, eight of the significantly upregulated chaperones are direct gene targets of heat shock transcription factor-1. By performing absolute quantification of chaperones under heat stress for the first time, we were able to evaluate the individual protein-level response. Furthermore, this SRM data was used to calibrate label-free quantification values for the proteome in absolute terms, thus improving relative quantification between the two conditions. This study significantly enhances the largely transcriptomic data available in the field and illustrates a more nuanced response at the protein level.
5	40	112	Medical 	 Osteoporosis  	 Osteoporosis; Orthopedic surgeons; Minimal trauma fracture; Responsibility; Attitudes        	A study of orthopedic surgeons in rural and regional Southeast Australia to determine attitudes to investigation and management of osteoporosis found they believe follow-up in regard to osteoporosis after MTF is important; responsibility for follow-up diagnosis and management lies with primary health care and current communication systems are poor. Purpose/introduction The investigation and treatment of osteoporosis after minimal trauma fracture (MTF) is regarded as sub-optimal. There is strong evidence of the benefit of identifying and treating osteoporosis after MTF, and there has been discussion of the possible role that orthopedic surgeons might play in the management of osteoporosis after MTF. The study surveyed orthopedic surgeons in rural and regional Southeast Australia to determine their attitudes to investigation and management of osteoporosis, the role health professionals should play, and the communication and coordination of follow-up care. Methods A survey was developed and piloted prior to being posted to 69 orthopedic surgeons asking for their opinions about the general management of osteoporosis, and the roles and responsibilities of health professionals in dealing with osteoporosis following an MTF. Results Responses were received from 42 participants (60.8%) with the majority of respondents agreeing that it is important to treat osteoporosis following MTF. Less than 15% of respondents felt that it was their responsibility to initiate discussion or treatment or investigation after MTF. No respondent felt that the coordination of osteoporosis care was good and 45% stated it was poor. Communication after discharge is mostly left to the hospital (30%), while 20% stated they did not follow up at all. This study shows that many rural orthopedic surgeons believe that follow-up in regard to osteoporosis after MTF is important, that responsibility for follow-up diagnosis and management of osteoporosis lies with primary health care and the current communication systems are poor.
0	8	8	CS 	 Relational databases  	 Specialized databases; Object relational databases; EclipseLink; Apache Derby; Object oriented programming        	Databases are imperative for research in bioinformatics and computational biology. Current challenges in database design include data heterogeneity and contextdependent interconnections between data entities. These challenges drove the development of unified data interfaces and specialized databases. The curation of specialized databases is an ever- growing challenge due to the introduction of new data sources and the emergence of new relational connections between established datasets. Here, an open- source framework for the curation of specialized databases is proposed. The framework supports user- designed models of data encapsulation, objects persistency and structured interfaces to local and external data sources such as MalaCards, Biomodels and the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases. The proposed framework was implemented using Java as the development environment, EclipseLink as the data persistency agent and Apache Derby as the database manager. Syntactic analysis was based on J3D, jsoup, Apache Commons and w3c. dom open libraries. Finally, a construction of a specialized database for aneurysms associated vascular diseases is demonstrated. This database contains 3- dimensional geometries of aneurysms, patient's clinical information, articles, biological models, related diseases and our recently published model of aneurysms' risk of rapture. Framework is available in: http:// nbel- lab. com.

This is the first study that deals with innovative programmes in research, learning and education in the field of physiological sciences. This broad-based MPhil would make its recipients competent, critical, confident and productive learner. This is a completely unique design of a curriculum that has no comparable examples elsewhere. Our mission is to educate graduate students in the field of Physiological Sciences such that they have a complete grasp over the broad-based integrated concepts of basic health sciences. Upon completion of their education, the students will be able to use the duality of imagination and skepticism. Hence, the students will contribute to their fields by unfolding their creative energy.
2	10	43	Psychology  	 Schizophrenia  	 vitamin D; mental disorders; avitaminosis; risk factors; protective factors        	This research aimed to investigate factors associated with vitamin D deficiency and to provide data about its prevalence in patients suffering from different psychiatric illnesses. The study had a cross-sectional design and it included 220 patients of both genders, aged from 19-81 y, with a wide range of mental disorders (F00 F89), and treated in routine ambulatory and hospital practice. The researchers collected data from three sources: medical records, a study questionnaire and biochemical analysis of patients' serum samples (concentration of vitamin D measured as 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, methods for hypothesis testing and binary logistic regression, at the p <= 0.05 level. A total of 140 patients (64%) had a deficiency of vitamin D (20 ng/mL). Among variables related to demographics, life style habits, mental illness, comorbid disorders and drugs, two of them, female gender (odds ratio (OR)=2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.3-4.9, p=0.006) and using clozapine (OR =-15.6, 95% CI 1.7-144.7, p=0.02), were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency. Physical activity (OR= 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, p=0.02), exercising (OR= 0.2, 95% CI <0.1-0.7, p=0.02) and offal in the diet (OR=0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9, p=0.03) significantly aggregated in the patients who had a 25(OH)D serum concentration above the deficiency cut-off level. Patients with mental disorders are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, particularly females and clozapine users as well as those having no adequate physical activity or dietary habits.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Anxiety; Cancer; Coping; Depression; Distress; Social support        	Background: Psychosocial distress is common among cancer patients. Significant associations between coping and social support with distress and quality of life in adult cancer patients have been identified before, but little is known about the interrelationships between distress, medical coping, and social support in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Objective: The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress in Chinese AYAs with cancer and examine the associations among distress, anxiety and depression, medical coping, and social support in the same population. Methods: A total of 610 AYA patients were recruited for this study; 551 patients completed the Chinese version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (DT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, and the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: The prevalence of psychological distress was 89.1% in Chinese AYAs with cancer. The DT scores were the highest in the 21-to 25-year-old patients; the DT scores were positively correlated with anxiety and depression (PG. 01) but negatively correlated with medical coping and social support (PG. 01). Conclusion: The prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients was higher than that in the general cancer population. Medical coping and social support can lower the prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients. Implications for Practice: Findings suggest the need for evidence-based intervention strategies to enhance medical coping and social support in AYA cancer patients. Nurses are crucial to implementing psychological interventions in AYA cancer patients.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 Collaborative approaches to leadership; communities of practice; distributed leadership; networks for building capacity; science and mathematics education        	The literature suggests that collaborative approaches to leadership, such as distributed leadership, are essential for supporting educational innovators in leading change in teaching in universities. This paper briefly describes the array of activities, processes and resources to support distributed leadership in the implementation of a network, the Science and Mathematics Network of Australian University Educators - SaMnet. The research study investigated participating educational innovators' experiences of distributed leadership using a mixed method approach after 2 years of immersion in SaMnet. Fifty innovators from 100 were surveyed and data analysed to obtain influences of the teams, the institution and SaMnet. Focus groups were used to extract rich descriptions of the experiences of the innovators. The study suggests that distributed leadership as the approach underpinning SaMnet cultivated leadership helping to complement team and institutional influences in a measurable way and to support educational innovators in leading change in university science and mathematics teaching.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 social network; cloud model; trust evaluation; reputation trust; transaction trust        	How to develop a trust management model and then to efficiently control and manage nodes is an important issue in the scope of social network security. In this paper, a trust management model based on a cloud model is proposed. The cloud model uses a specific computation operator to achieve the transformation from qualitative concepts to quantitative computation. Additionally, this can also be used to effectively express the fuzziness, randomness and the relationship between them of the subjective trust. The node trust is divided into reputation trust and transaction trust. In addition, evaluation methods are designed, respectively. Firstly, the two-dimension trust cloud evaluation model is designed based on node's comprehensive and trading experience to determine the reputation trust. The expected value reflects the average trust status of nodes. Then, entropy and hyper-entropy are used to describe the uncertainty of trust. Secondly, the calculation methods of the proposed direct transaction trust and the recommendation transaction trust involve comprehensively computation of the transaction trust of each node. Then, the choosing strategies were designed for node to trade based on trust cloud. Finally, the results of a simulation experiment in P2P network file sharing on an experimental platform directly reflect the objectivity, accuracy and robustness of the proposed model, and could also effectively identify the malicious or unreliable service nodes in the system. In addition, this can be used to promote the service reliability of the nodes with high credibility, by which the stability of the whole network is improved.
0	9	9	CS 	 Software engineering  	 Cooperative systems; learning systems; software engineering        	Developing a complex intelligent system by abstracting their behaviors, functionalities, and reasoning mechanisms can be tedious and time consuming. In this paper, we present a framework for developing an application or software system based on smart autonomous components that collaborate with the developer or user to realize the entire system. Inspired by teachable approaches and programming-by-demonstration methods in robotics and end-user development, we treat intelligent agents as teachable components that make up the system to be built. Each agent serves different functionalities and may have prebuilt operations to accomplish its own design objectives. However, each agent may also be equipped with in-built social-cognitive traits to interact with the user or other agents in order to adapt its own operations, objectives, and relationships with others. The results of adaptation can be in the form of groups or multiagent systems as new aggregated components. This approach is made to tackle the difficulties in completely programming the entire system by allowing the user to teach the components toward the desired behaviors in the situated context of the application. We exemplify this novel method with cases in the domains of human-like agents in virtual environment and agents for in-house caregiving.

Special attention is given to relevant technical, formal and functional solutions, being the domain of interior architects creating the built environments of adequate indoor quality with substantial reduction of negative impact on natural environment. Presented sustainable architectural interiors, completed in the last decade, have gained cerificates established by independent scientific institutions, assuring their accordance with exigencies of rating systems. The paper analyzes the formal methods of proper space planning, which assure high indoor environment quality parameters for the end users of office interiors in terms of optimum daylighyting of workstations and recreational areas as well as workers' visual contact with natural valuable surroundings. These requirements can be satisfactorily met by properly shaped inner space elements including partitions, ceilings, space-dividing structures as well as rational and effective use of finishing and building materials. Technical and technological devices incorporated into the inner space mentioned in the paper are supposed to be essential complement of these design methods assuring proper daylight transmission and distribution in workspaces. Discussed examples indicate the necessity of collaboration of interior architects with other professionals and consultants (i.e. green building accredited consultants), whose design contributions should be accepted and respected. Integrated interior design process assured fulfilment of imperatives for sustainable architectural design of interiors.
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 PTP1B; Diabetes; N-alkylated TZD; Docking        	Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B enzyme has been found to be a negative regulator of insulin and leptin signaling pathway. It has gained considerable attention to medicinal chemists as a new therapeutic target for intervention in the treatment of type2 diabetes. A series of N-substituted-5-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were synthesized and screened in vitro for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitory activity and in vivo for anti-hyperglycaemic activity. The introduction of alkyl/halo alkyl moiety onto the amidic nitrogen of thiazolidine-2,4-dione ring was intended to enhance the inhibitor-enzyme affinity and hence, good protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibition. The nature of interactions which governs the binding mode of ligands inside the active site of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B was further studied by molecular docking simulation. Compound 7 was found to be a potent protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitor with IC50 9.96 A mu M. The synthesized compounds have also shown significant lowering of blood glucose level.
5	42	114	Medical 	 Parenting  	 Child physical abuse potential; Child physical abuse; Marital status; Divorce; Depression symptoms; Mediation        	Informed by a social interactional framework of stress and parenting, the aim of this study was to examine the mediating effect of depression symptoms on the association between parents' marital status (married and divorced parents) and child physical abuse potential, in a Portuguese community sample. It was hypothesized that the possible observed differences between divorced and married parents in the child physical abuse potential would be explained by their depression symptoms. Parents (N = 892) were assessed in their marital status, severity of depression symptoms and child physical abuse potential. Results showed that, when compared with married parents, divorced parents had higher child physical abuse potential. However, parents' depression symptomatology was found as a mediator of the effect of marital status differences on child physical abuse potential. The influence of the status of divorced parents on the increase of child physical abuse potential was explained by the increase of the parents' depression symptoms. This finding suggested that parents' divorced status had no longer an effect on child physical abuse potential when parents' depression symptomatology was tested as a mediator variable. The present mediation model explained 47 % of the variability in the child physical abuse potential score. Practical implications of these findings for prevention and psychological intervention are also discussed.
0	5	5	CS 	 Computer graphics  	 phase retrieval; computer-generated holograms; holography        	A phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) calculation method for stereoscopic holography is proposed in this paper. The two-dimensional (2D) perspective projection views of the three-dimensional (3D) object are generated by the computer graphics rendering techniques. Based on these views, a phase-only hologram is calculated by using the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) iterative algorithm. Comparing with the non-iterative algorithm in the conventional stereoscopic holography, the proposed method improves the holographic image quality, especially for the phase-only hologram encoded from the complex distribution. Both simulation and optical experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method can give higher quality reconstruction comparing with the traditional method.
5	1	73	Medical 	 Allergies  	 Clove; Eugenia caryophyllata; Eugenol; Dendritic cell; Immunity; Hypersensitivity        	Caryophyllata Flos or clove is widely used as a condiment and in Chinese medicine. It reportedly helps relieve asthma and allergies; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, the mechanism affecting dendritic cells (DCs), which play a critical role in the immune response, remains unknown. In this study, we examine the effects of Caryophyllata Flos methanolic extract (CFME) and its major compound, eugenol, on DC functions. Our results showed that CFME and eugenol significantly inhibited DC activation and maturation. The IC50s of CFME and eugenol were approximately 25 mu g/mL and 50 mu M, respectively. CFME and eugenol halted T-cell proliferation. Contact hypersensitivity responses were inhibited in mice cosensitized with either CFME or eugenol. We demonstrated for the first time that clove and its major active ingredient, eugenol, exhibited a significant immunosuppressive effect on DC functions, revealing that clove is a functional food that can ameliorate chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.

2	8	41	Psychology  	 Borderline personality disorder  	 Quality of life; Costs; Borderline; Mentalization-based treatment        	Background: Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) is a promising, though expensive treatment for severely ill patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). A high burden of disease in terms of quality of life (QoL) and life years lost can be a reason to prioritize mental health interventions, and specifically for BPD patients. Moreover, when the societal costs of the illness are high, spending resources on high treatment costs would be more easily legitimized. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to calculate the burden of disease of BPD patients eligible for MBT. Methods: The 403 patients included in this study were recruited from two mental health care institutes in the Netherlands. All patients were eligible for MBT. Burden of disease consisted of QoL, measured with the EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, and costs, calculated using the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire for Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness. Results: The mean QoL index score was .48. The mean total costs in the year prior to treatment were (sic) 16,879 per patient, of which 21 % consisted of productivity costs. Conclusions: The burden of disease in BPD patients eligible for MBT is high, which makes it more likely that society is willing to invest in treatment for these patients. However, this finding should not be interpreted as a license to unlimitedly use resources to reimburse treatment for severe BPD patients, as these findings do not provide any information on the effectiveness of MBT or other available treatment programs for BPD. The effectiveness of available treatments should be evident by studies on the effectiveness of the treatment itself and by comparing the effectiveness of these treatments to treatment as usual and to other treatment options for BPD patients.
4	9	70	Civil 	 Construction Management  	 construction industry; construction management; lean construction; lean construction principles; scheduling; Monte Carlo simulation        	Performance of the construction projects have been criticized for many years due to their low productivity rates and cost overruns as well as significant delays. Increasing number of dissatisfied customers compel practitioners to reform conventional practices of construction management. Lean construction has emerged as a result of these efforts in the industry. However, there are limited number of studies that demonstrate the practical benefits of lean construction applications. The aim of this paper is to untangle practical applications of lean construction and to reveal their benefits. A methodology was developed to compare the lean and non-lean scenarios of a residential building project by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation models were generated through regular meetings held with construction planning experts. Research findings demonstrate that application of lean construction principles have a potential to improve the performance of projects by reducing both the total project duration and its expected variation. In addition, the study revealed that utilization of practical lean construction principles may result in a considerable amount of time reduction in wall construction and plastering activities of residential building projects. Although the findings of this study cannot be generalized, they are expected to encourage practitioners to adopt lean construction principles.

Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris, the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1 gene was cloned with an N-terminal a-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C, and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran. Substrate specificity profile and descriptor-based analysis demonstrated unique properties, showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

5	12	84	Medical 	 Children's Health  	 Prenatal maternal stress; Body mass index; Waist to height ratio; Longitudinal design; Childhood and adolescence        	Background: The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide has become a public health issue. While many factors are involved in the development of obesity, stress during pregnancy has been linked to adiposity. However, research involving stressors that are independent of pregnant women's socioeconomic and psychological characteristics is rare. The present study made use of a natural disaster (1998 Quebec ice storm) to determine which aspect of the women's disaster experience (objective hardship, subjective stress, and/or cognitive appraisal) were associated with body mass index levels and/or waist to height ratio across childhood and adolescence. Methods: Measure of objective hardship, subjective stress, and cognitive appraisal were obtained following the 1998 Quebec ice storm. We measured height, weight, and waist circumference in children at ages 51/2, 81/2, 111/2, 131/2, and 151/2. Results: Our results show that higher prenatal maternal stress was associated with higher body mass index levels and central adiposity in children of ages 51/2, 81/2, 131/2, and 151/2. The effects of prenatal maternal stress on anthropometric measurements tend to increase as the children grew older. Discussion: The findings of this study highlight the long-lasting effect of prenatal stress on body composition, and are compatible with the current theory of fetal programming. Hopefully, our increased knowledge of the effects of prenatal stress on the fetus will lead to improved awareness and the creation of early intervention programs, ultimately improving women's and children's health in the future.

Data from an experimental study are used as input to the simulations and also for comparison with the numerical results. A conjugate heat transfer approach was used for the simulations, where best agreement with experiments was obtained from the simulation that included thermal radiation and utilized an experimentally obtained velocity profile as inlet velocity. A yet more detailed inlet velocity profile and more advanced turbulent model could result in an even better agreement.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 SCS-CN; Urbanization; Urban watersheds; Runoff; Impervious surface area; Rooftop rainwater harvesting        	The changing land use due to rapid urbanization has profound impact on the runoff in urban watersheds. The spatial analysis in urban watersheds is felt necessary for management of surface and subsurface water regimes. Significant increase in impervious zones was observed in Nagpur urban watersheds between 2000 and 2012 having impacts on runoff, and even flash floods were observed. This study presents spatial and temporal impacts of change in urban built-up area on curve number (CN) and runoff during the years 2000 and 2012. The study also analyzes effect of slope on CN values and shows that CN increases with slope. High-resolution satellite images were used to map impervious surface areas (ISAs) which show an increase of 0.9 to 34 % during 2000-2012. Spearman's and Pearson's coefficients have been generated to establish relationship between runoff, impervious surface areas, vegetation index, slope, and runoff coefficient. It has been hypothetically assumed that if 100, 50, and 25 % rooftop rainwater harvesting is considered, the estimated runoff reduces in 2012 as compared to the year 2000. The study suggests that increase in impervious areas within urban watersheds can be utilized for groundwater augmentation adopting rooftop rainwater-harvesting techniques and to prevent flash floods.
5	11	83	Medical 	 Birth Control  	 Anti-fertility; Bin1b; C3d; Recombinant vector vaccine        	Objectives To study the anti-fertility effect of a DNA vaccine using Bin1b as the target antigen in male mice.Methods A novel recombinant eukaryotic vector containing a fusion gene sequence of mouse Bin1b in tandem with three copies of C3d fragment (C3d3) was used to construct pSG.SS.C3d3.YL.Bin1b. The correct expression of the Bin1b-C3d3 protein was confirmed in transfected HEK293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. The fertility of immunised mice was determined by a mating experiment and sperm motility test. Anti-Bin1b antibody titres in sera were examined by ELISA assays. Binding activity of C3d3 fragment of the fusion protein was verified in C3d receptor-expressing Raji cells and flow cytometric analysis.Results Immunisation of pSG.SS.C3d3.YL.Bin1b recombinant DNA vaccine significantly decreased sperm motility and compromised fertility in male mice. ELISA results showed that the titres of anti-Bin1b IgG in sera of immunised mice increased markedly with the immunisation process. Further, the anti-fertility effect of pSG.SS.C3d3.YL.Bin1b was significantly better than that of pSG.SS.YL.Bin1b DNA vaccine and generated higher titres of anti-Bin1b antibody.Conclusions Our results show that recombinant DNA vaccine targeting Bin1b can markedly reduce fertility in male mice, providing an alternative approach for birth control.
0	15	15	CS 	 Data structures  	 congenital heart disease (CHD); congenital heart surgery; database (all types); outcomes (includes mortality; morbidity)        	The growth in large-scale data management capabilities and the successful care of patients with congenital heart defects have coincidentally paralleled each other for the last three decades, and participation in multicenter congenital heart disease databases and registries is now a fundamental component of cardiac care. This manuscript attempts for the first time to consolidate in one location all of the relevant databases worldwide, including target populations, specialties, Web sites, and participation information. Since at least 1,992 cardiac surgeons and cardiologists began leveraging this burgeoning technology to create multi-institutional data collections addressing a variety of specialties within this field. Pediatric heart diseases are particularly well suited to this methodology because each individual care location has access to only a relatively limited number of diagnoses and procedures in any given calendar year. Combining multiple institutions data therefore allows for a far more accurate contemporaneous assessment of treatment modalities and adverse outcomes. Additionally, the data can be used to develop outcome benchmarks by which individual institutions can measure their progress against the field as a whole and focus quality improvement efforts in a more directed fashion, and there is increasing utilization combining clinical research efforts within existing data structures. Efforts are ongoing to support better collaboration and integration across data sets, to improve efficiency, further the utility of the data collection infrastructure and information collected, and to enhance return on investment for participating institutions.
0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 Under researched plants of North-East India; Molecular docking; Bioinformatics; Chitinase        	Chitinases are varied sized proteins which have the ability to degrade chitin and are present in a huge range of organisms like fungi, yeasts, arthropods, humans etc. and have been getting increased attention due to their biocontrol properties. In silico analysis sheds light on the extensive properties of this plant protein. In this paper, a particular antifungal protein Chitinase sourced from Sechium edule from East Khasi Hills, Meghalaya was characterized using an array of bioinformatics tools. The modelled protein showed conserved domains characteristic to glycosyl hydrolase, family 18 superfamily. Likewise, a part of the conserved domain area fits in with xylanase inhibitor Xip-1 and the class III plant chitinases, for example, concanavalin B, hevamine, which have a GH18 area. The modelled wild type protein exhibited secondary characteristics comprising of 48.8% helix, 62.2% sheets and 13.8% turns, displaying an aliphatic index of 80,53 and instability index of 48.88 inferring upon the fact that the protein is relatively unstable without its appropriate environment. The paper functions as the first attempt to portray molecular dynamics simulation of Chitinase from Sechium edule reinforced by modelling and thorough characteristic analysis of the protein by employing parameters like Ramachandran Plot, Chou and Fasman Secondary Structure prediction, ProtParam etc. Further approaches like protein engineering and activity analysis suggested.

Methods: Literature review, consensus meetings, and a retrospective chart review of patients with probable AD were conducted. Results: Literature review showed that RCD definitions varied. Mini-Mental State Examination scores <20 at treatment onset, vascular risk factors, age= 3 points/year) is more common in moderate (43.2%) than in mild patients (20.1%; P<.001). Rapid and slow decliners had similar age, gender, and education levels at baseline. Discussion: RCD is sufficiently common to interfere with randomized clinical trials. We propose a 6-month prerandomization determination of the decline rate or use of an RCD risk score to ensure balanced allocation among treatment groups. (C) 2017 the Alzheimer's Association.

3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 Flight; lift theory; d'Alembert's paradox        	We present a new mathematical theory explaining the fluid mechanics of subsonic flight, which is fundamentally different from the existing boundary layer-circulation theory by Prandtl-Kutta-Zhukovsky formed 100 year ago. The new theory is based on our new resolution of d'Alembert's paradox showing that slightly viscous bluff body flow can be viewed as zero-drag/lift potential flow modified by 3d rotational slip separation arising from a specific separation instability of potential flow, into turbulent flow with nonzero drag/lift. For a wing this separation mechanism maintains the large lift of potential flow generated at the leading edge at the price of small drag, resulting in a lift to drag quotient of size 15-20 for a small propeller plane at cruising speed with Reynolds number Re approximate to 10(7) and a jumbojet at take-off and landing with Re approximate to 10(8), which allows flight at affordable power. The new mathematical theory is supported by computed turbulent solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with a slip boundary condition as a model of observed small skin friction of a turbulent boundary layer always arising for Re >10(6), in close accordance with experimental observations over the entire range of angle of attacks including stall using a few millions of mesh points for a full wing-body configuration.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 computer graphics; computer vision; survey; scene understanding; image manipulation        	The computer graphics and computer vision communities have been working closely together in recent years, and a variety of algorithms and applications have been developed to analyze and manipulate the visual media around us. There are three major driving forces behind this phenomenon: 1) the availability of big data from the Internet has created a demand for dealing with the ever-increasing, vast amount of resources; 2) powerful processing tools, such as deep neural networks, provide effective ways for learning how to deal with heterogeneous visual data; 3) new data capture devices, such as the Kinect, the bridge between algorithms for 2D image understanding and 3D model analysis. These driving forces have emerged only recently, and we believe that the computer graphics and computer vision communities are still in the beginning of their honeymoon phase. In this work we survey recent research on how computer vision techniques benefit computer graphics techniques and vice versa, and cover research on analysis, manipulation, synthesis, and interaction. We also discuss existing problems and suggest possible further research directions.
5	18	90	Medical 	 Emergency Contraception  	 Obesity; Body mass index; Contraceptive effectiveness; Meta-analysis; Hazard ratio        	Objective: The objective of this investigation was to assess the potential effect of obesity on the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (HCs). Study Design: A meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data directly from the Phase 3 clinical trials of combination oral contraceptives (COCs) rather than extracting summary data from literature. Trials selected were reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2000 and 2012, conducted in North America, had more than six 28-day cycle equivalents of exposure, and had readily retrievable participant-level data. Contraceptive effectiveness was measured by the Pearl Index (PI: the number of pregnancies per 100 woman-years) in women aged 18-35 at risk of unintended pregnancy. The incidence rate ratio (IRR), a ratio of PIs for obese women (defined as body mass index [BMI] >= 30 kg/m(2)) compared to non-obese women (BMI <30 kg/m(2)) was calculated. A Cox proportional-hazard regression model with fixed and random-effects were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for unintended pregnancy in obese women compared to non-obese women. Results: Seven clinical trials with COCs (N=14,024: 2707 obese and 11,317 non-obese women) met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The PI for each trial varied: 2.05-5.08 for obese and 1.84-3.80 for non-obese women. The pooled PI estimated using direct weighted average method was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.33-4.22) for obese and 2.53 (95% CI: 1.88-3.41) for non-obese women. The pooled IRRs estimated using direct weighted average and Mantel-Haenszel adjustment methods were comparable: 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.84) and 1.43 (95% CI: 1.07-1.92), respectively. The overall HR of 1.44 (95% CI: 1.06-1.95; p=.018) in the meta-analysis suggested a 44% higher pregnancy rate during COC use for obese women after adjusting for age and race. Implications Statement: Obesity may increase the risk of unintended pregnancy in women using COCs; more data on obese women from ongoing and future Phase 3 clinical trials are necessary to allow further evaluation of this topic. Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that obese women may have a higher pregnancy rate during COC use compared to non-obese women. Future analysis should assess differences in pharmacodynamics or compliance that could potentially account for the observed difference in unintended pregnancy rates. Published by Elsevier Inc.
5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 post-traumatic osteoarthritis; articular cartilage; meniscus; animal model; contact stress        	Acute mechanical damage and the resulting joint contact abnormalities are central to the initiation and progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Study of PTOA is typically performed in vivo with replicate animals using artificially induced injury features. The goal of this work was to measure changes in a joint contact stress in the knee of a large quadruped after creation of a clinically realistic overload injury and a focal cartilage defect. Whole-joint overload was achieved by excising a 5-mm wedge of the anterior medial meniscus. Focal cartilage defects were created using a custom pneumatic impact gun specifically developed and mechanically characterized for this work. To evaluate the effect of these injuries on joint contact mechanics, Tekscan (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA) measurements were obtained pre-operatively, postmeniscectomy, and postimpact (1.2-J) in a nonrandomized group of axially loaded cadaveric sheep knees. Postmeniscectomy, peak contact stress in the medial compartment is increased by 71% (p = 0.03) and contact area is decreased by 35% (p = 0.001); the center of pressure (CoP) shifted toward the cruciate ligaments in both the medial (p = 0.004) and lateral (p = 0.03) compartments. The creation of a cartilage defect did not significantly change any aspect of contact mechanics measured in the meniscectomized knee. This work characterizes the mechanical environment present in a quadrupedal animal knee joint after two methods to reproducibly induce joint injury features that lead to PTOA.
2	5	38	Psychology  	 Leadership  	 deprivation; inequalities; intellectual disabilities; social services; welfare        	Many people with intellectual disabilities rely on social care provision, though little research has looked at how access to such provision is distributed nationally. Evidence from children's services suggests that there are large discrepancies between local authorities (LAs) in terms of the resources expended on interventions with children and families, which can be explained by variations linked to geographical location, namely the level of socioeconomic deprivation between LAs, constituting 'child welfare inequalities'. This study explored relationships between resources allocated to community services for people with intellectual disabilities in England and geographical factors, including deprivation, rurality and political leadership in the LAs where these individuals reside. Data were sourced from publicly available reports of spending of 151 English councils with adult social services responsibilities (CASSRs) for 2013-2014 and from CASSR index of multiple deprivation (IMD) scores and rurality for the same period. We found that more deprived LAs supported more people with intellectual disabilities, per 100,000 of population. We did not find effects for rurality or political party. However, it was not the case that more deprived LAs allocated more funds for expenditure on this group. These findings point to inequities in the distribution of social care resources for people with intellectual disabilities in England, as although more deprived LAs support more people with intellectual disabilities, they do not spend proportionally larger sums of money on this group. We discuss possible explanations for these findings and highlight the need for more research, particularly investigations about allocation of resources within LAs and more detailed explorations of how structural factors such as socioeconomic status of service users effects service access at the local level.
3	4	56	MAE 	 Fluid mechanics  	 Microgravity; Drop tower; Release mechanism; Deceleration device; Aerodynamic optimization        	Microgravity experiments are essential for research in space science, biology, fluid mechanics, combustion, and material sciences. One way to conduct microgravity experiments on Earth is by using drop tower facilities. These facilities combine a high quality of microgravity, adequate payload masses and have the advantage of virtually unlimited repeatability under same experimental conditions, at a low cost. In a collaboration between the Institute of Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart and Baylor University (BU) in Waco, Texas, a new drop tower is currently under development at the Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics and Engineering Research (CASPER). The design parameters of the drop tower ask for at least 1.5 sin free fall duration while providing a quality of at least 10(-5) g. Previously, this quality has only been achieved in vacuum drop tower facilities where the capsule experiences virtually zero aerodynamic drag during its free fall. Since this design comes at high costs, a different drop tower design concept, which does not require an evacuated drop shaft, was chosen. It features a dual-capsule system in which the experiment capsule is shielded from aerodynamic forces by surrounding it with a drag shield during the drop. As no other dual-capsule drop tower has been able to achieve a quality as good as or better than 10-5 g previous work optimized the design with an aerodynamic perspective by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to determine the ideal shape and size of the outer capsule and to specify the aerodynamically crucial dimensions for the overall system. Experiments later demonstrated that the required quality of microgravity can be met with the proposed design. The main focus of this paper is the mechanical realization of the capsule as well as the development and layout of the surrounding components, such as the release mechanism, the deceleration device and the drop shaft. Because the drop tower facility is a complex system with many interdependencies between all of the components, several engineering challenges had to be addressed. For example, initial disturbances that are caused by the release mechanism are a common issue that arises at drop tower facilities. These vibrations may decrease the quality of microgravity during the initial segment of free fall. Because this would reduce the free fall time experiencing high quality microgravity, a mechanism has been developed to provide a soft release. Challenges and proposed solutions for all components are highlighted in this paper.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 eHealth; Semantic modelling; Continuous care; Context dissemination; Ontology; Ambient intelligence        	Background: The ultimate ambient-intelligent care room contains numerous sensors and devices to monitor the patient, sense and adjust the environment and support the staff. This sensor-based approach results in a large amount of data, which can be processed by current and future applications, e. g., task management and alerting systems. Today, nurses are responsible for coordinating all these applications and supplied information, which reduces the added value and slows down the adoption rate. The aim of the presented research is the design of a pervasive and scalable framework that is able to optimize continuous care processes by intelligently reasoning on the large amount of heterogeneous care data. Methods: The developed Ontology-based Care Platform (OCarePlatform) consists of modular components that perform a specific reasoning task. Consequently, they can easily be replicated and distributed. Complex reasoning is achieved by combining the results of different components. To ensure that the components only receive information, which is of interest to them at that time, they are able to dynamically generate and register filter rules with a Semantic Communication Bus (SCB). This SCB semantically filters all the heterogeneous care data according to the registered rules by using a continuous care ontology. The SCB can be distributed and a cache can be employed to ensure scalability. Results: A prototype implementation is presented consisting of a new-generation nurse call system supported by a localization and a home automation component. The amount of data that is filtered and the performance of the SCB are evaluated by testing the prototype in a living lab. The delay introduced by processing the filter rules is negligible when 10 or fewer rules are registered. Conclusions: The OCarePlatform allows disseminating relevant care data for the different applications and additionally supports composing complex applications from a set of smaller independent components. This way, the platform significantly reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed by the nurses. The delay resulting from processing the filter rules is linear in the amount of rules. Distributed deployment of the SCB and using a cache allows further improvement of these performance results.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 CO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC); Waste heat recovery; Engine; Preheater; Regenerator        	CO2-based transcritical Rankine cycle (CTRC) is a promising technology for the waste heat recovery of an engine considering its safety and environment friendly characteristics, which also matchs the high temperature of the exhaust gas and satisfies the miniaturization demand of recovery systems. But the traditional CTRC system with a basic configuration (B-CTRC) has a poor thermodynamic performance. This paper introduces an improved CTRC system containing both a preheater and regenerator (PR-CTRC), for recovering waste heat in exhaust gas and engine coolant of an engine, and compares its performance with that of the B-CTRC system and also with that of the traditional excellent Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems using R123 as a working fluid. The utilization rate of waste heat, total cooling load, net power output, thermal efficiency, exergy loss, exergy efficiency and component size have been investigated. Results show that, the net power output of the PR-CTRC could reach up to 9.0 kW for a 43.8 kW engine, which increases by 150% compared with that of the B-CTRC (3.6 kW). The PR-CTRC also improves the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency of the B-CTRC, with increases of 184% and 227%, respectively. Compared with the ORC system, the PR-CTRC shows the significant advantage of highly recycling the exhaust gas and engine coolant simultaneously due to the special property of supercritical CO2's specific heat capacity. The supercritical property of CO2 also generates a better heat transfer and flowing performances. Meanwhile, the PR-CTRC possesses a smaller SP (0.010-0.020 m) than that of R123 systems (0.055-0.070 m). Therefore, the PR-CTRC system is suitable for the waste heat recovery of an engine, especially for recovering both high-grade and low-grade waste heat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	34	106	Medical 	 Menopause  	 Information; Internet; premature ejaculation        	Premature ejaculation is one of the most common male sexual dysfunctions; however, only a few patients with premature ejaculation are seeking professional help or advice. Internet has become an important source of knowledge, and thus, more patients are looking online for health information. According to our best knowledge, no study has evaluated the content and quality of websites on premature ejaculation. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the content and quality of currently available Internet-based information on premature ejaculation. A sample was obtained comprising the 50 top sites retrieved from Google, Bing and Yahoo search engines using the terms premature ejaculation'. Each site then was reviewed based on some predefined evaluation criteria to determine the general quality, condition-specific content quality, popularity index and ownership. The websites reviewed were differed highly in terms of quality and ownership. Only a few sites provided comprehensive medical and complete information on premature ejaculation. The online information available is often of uncertain calibre; therefore, men are being exposed to information about premature ejaculation with a highly variable degree quality. This fact should be considered both by health professionals and website owners, and better online resources should be provided for these patients.
5	44	116	Medical 	 Polycythemia Vera  	 extramedullary hematopoietic; decompressive laminectomy; thalassemia major        	Spinal cord compression due to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) is a rare complication of thalassemia and generally presents as paraparesis with sensory impairment. Complete paraplegia is extremely rare in EMH due to thalassemia although it is known to occur in polycythemia vera and sickle cell anemia. Cases presenting with paraparesis have been treated with either surgery or radiotherapy with equal frequency and efficacy. Almost all reported cases with paraplegia have been treated with surgery with or without radiation therapy. As paraplegia secondary to EMH is rare, there is no consensus on treatment. We hereby report a case of thalassemia with paraplegia treated successfully with surgery. Treatment options for cord compression include primarily blood transfusion, surgery, and radiation therapy. Because of the extreme rarity of this condition, direct comparisons between various treatment modalities are not possible. The bias toward surgery is due to its immediate decompressing effect. EMH in thalassemia has also been treated with transfusion therapy with the rationale that correction of anemia would downregulate erythropoietin and lead to reversal of EMH. However, improvement with blood transfusion alone is usually incomplete and slow. Our patient did not improve after adequate blood transfusion and hence underwent surgical decompression after which he showed rapid and complete neurologic recovery. Therefore, we conclude that surgical decompression of EMH tissue has to be considered early in patients presenting with paraplegia if symptom shows no improvement after adequate blood transfusion.
2	13	46	Psychology  	 Prenatal development  	 cytoplasmic transfer; repeated implantation failure; survey; limited follow-up; disclosure to children        	Experimental ooplasmic transplantation from donor to recipient oocyte took place between 1996 and 2001 at Saint Barnabas Medical Center, USA. Indication for 33 patients was repeated implantation failure. Thirteen couples had 17 babies. One patient delivered twins from mixed ooplasmic and donor egg embryos. A limited survey-based follow-up study on the children is reported: 12 out of 13 parents completed a questionnaire on pregnancy, birth, health, academic performance and disclosure. Parents of a quadruplet did not participate. Prenatal development and delivery were uneventful. School grades ranged from good to excellent. Children were of good health. Body mass index (BMI) was normal in 12 out of 13 children. One child had chronic migraine headaches, two mild asthma, three minor vision and three minor skin problems. One boy from a boy/girl twin was diagnosed with borderline pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified at age 18 months, but with no later symptoms. One couple disclosed the use of egg donor to their child. One reported intention to disclose; six were undecided and four reported they would not disclose. This limited follow-up strategy presents a high risk of bias. Parents may not assent to standardized clinical analysis owing to lack of disclosure to their children. (C) 2016 The Authors.

5	44	116	Medical 	 Polycythemia Vera  	 drug development; imaging; target engagement; treatment response; drug safety; mechanism of action; 3Rs        	It is well understood that the biopharmaceutical industry must improve efficiency along the path from laboratory concept to commercial product. In vivo imaging is recognized as a useful method to provide biomarkers for target engagement, treatment response, safety, and mechanism of action. Imaging biomarkers have the potential to inform the selection of drugs that are more likely to be safe and effective. Most of the imaging modalities for biopharmaceutical research are translatable to the clinic. In vivo imaging does not require removal of tissue to provide biomarkers, thus reducing the number of valuable preclinical subjects required for a study. Longitudinal imaging allows for quantitative intra-subject comparisons, enhancing statistical power, and further reducing the number of subjects needed for the evaluation of treatment effects in animal models. The noninvasive nature of in vivo imaging also provides a valuable approach to alleviate or minimize potential pain, suffering or distress.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Hypertension; depression; health burden        	Depression and hypertension frequently present together in clinical practice. Evaluating the interaction between depression and hypertension would help stakeholders better understand the value of depression prevention in primary care. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the excessive burden of depression on overall health and on health care utilization expenditure among hypertensive patients. A total of 7019 hypertensive patients (ICD-9-CM: 401) were identified from the 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS 2012) data, of which 936 patients had depression (ICD-9-CM: 311). Hypertension with depression was associated with worse health status (physical component score, -3.97 [17.9% reduction]; mental component score, -9.14 [9% reduction]), higher utilization of health care services (outpatient visits, 6.4 [63.8% higher]; nights of hospitalization, 0.9 [100% higher]; medication prescription, 22.6 [76.8% higher]), and higher health care expenditures (inpatient, $1953.2 [72% higher]; prescription drugs, $1995.5 [82% higher]).
4	4	65	Civil 	 Water Pollution  	 Adsorption; biochars; phosphorus; structural properties        	In many areas of the world, leaching of phosphorus in the soil causes serious water pollution. The purpose of this research was to decrease the phosphorus loss in soil by the adsorption behavior of biochars with special structural characteristics. In this study, a series of analysis methods including scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, elemental composition, thermogravimetric, and X-ray diffractometer analysis have been used to investigate the properties and structures of different sources of biochars. The adsorption of phosphorus by maize-straw biochar, rice-hull biochar, and pine biochar was quantified by the balance method in this research. The results show that pine biochar has more structural and thermal stability than maize-straw biochar and rice-hull biochar. Different sources of biochar have significantly different phosphate adsorption capabilities. Pine biochar has the best phosphorus adsorption capacity; the actual maximum adsorption capacity was 13.898mgg(-1); however, the phosphorus adsorption capacity of maize-straw biochar was minimum, the actual maximum adsorption capacity was 8.809mgg(-1). The volume of phosphorus adsorption on biochars increases with increasing concentration of phosphorus added to the solution, but the rate of increase gradually decreases. The phosphorus adsorption curve agreed well with the Langmuir isotherm equation.
5	7	40	Medical 	 Depression  	 Burden; Caregivers; Mindfulness; Self-compassion; Stress; Usability        	Families living with mental illness express needs of support and experiences of burden that may affect their own health detrimentally and hence also their ability to support the patient. Mindfulness-based interventions have shown beneficial health effects in both clinical and healthy populations. The aim of the current study was to explore the effectiveness and usability of a web-based mindfulness program for families living with mental illness, which was first tested in a feasibility study. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial with an experiment group and a wait-list control group with assessments on primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Significant positive improvements in mindfulness and self-compassion, and significant decreases in perceived stress and in certain dimensions of caregiver burden were found, with good program usability. Easily accessible mindfulness-based interventions may be useful in addressing caregivers' needs of support and in preventing further ill health in caregivers. Further studies are needed, among others, to further customize interventions and to investigate the cost-effectiveness of such programs.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Stress classification; Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN); Signal encryption; Cooperative relay; Electrocardiogram (ECG)        	Information security is key important when we are trying to interconnect the wireless body sensor network with the healthcare social network via mobile facilities. In this paper, we specially work on a secured electrocardiogram (ECG) signal transmission scheme to prevent further injuries for patients with heart diseases from human emotional stress. We proposed a dynamic encryption method via biometric information among frequency spectrums of ECG signals, which can guarantee both high classification rate (>90 %) and system energy efficiency. At the same time, cooperative relays are applied for an additional spatial diversity gains. Simulation results show that the improved transmission rate and signal power capacity can lower the probability of data intercept (LPI) and detection (LPD) by taking the advantages of both temporal and spatial diversities. The network security thereby can be further improved.

However, the component architectures of these protocols are rarely implemented in Java for further evaluation. In this paper, we briefly discuss our previously proposed mobile transaction authentication protocol and extend our work by presenting its Java implementation. This implementation provides a detailed analysis based on a number of factors with respect to the security considerations of the protocol, particularly in its design stage. Thus, it provides a broad verification as well as step-by-step evaluation of the protocol specifications from its implementation point of view.

In addition, it presents an overview of the different types of inhalable formulations which have been developed in order to achieve efficient delivery of polyphenols to the respiratory tract. The main biological activities of polyphenols (anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory) are covered, with particular emphasis on the studies describing their therapeutic effects on different factors and conditions characteristic of lung pathologies. Special focus is on the technological aspects which influence the pulmonary delivery of drugs. The various polyphenol-based inhalable formulations reported in the literature are examined with specific attention to the preparation methodologies, aerosol performance, lung deposition and in vitro and in vivo polyphenol uptake by the pulmonary epithelial cells.
5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 Eczema; Paediatric; Atopic dermatitis; Anti-IgE; Omalizumab; Randomised controlled trial; Double blind; Placebo; Xolair (R)        	Background: The evidence for systemic treatments for severe childhood eczema is limited and largely based on extrapolation of data from adult studies. Current therapies are often immunosuppressant and may be associated with both short-and long-term side effects. There is increasing in vitro and murine-model evidence for the role of IgE in the immunopathogenesis of atopic eczema. The aim of the study is to assess whether anti-IgE treatment (omalizumab) improves eczema, compared to placebo. Methods/design: The Atopic Dermatitis Anti-IgE Paediatric Trial (ADAPT) is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing the role of anti-IgE in the management of severe paediatric eczema. Children with severe atopic eczema, with an objective SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score of over 40 will be recruited. These children are candidates for systemic therapy, have failed systemic therapy or have experienced side effects from systemic therapy. Sixty-two patients aged between 4 and 19 years will receive anti-IgE for 6 months. The primary outcome measure will be the validated eczema score, the objective SCORAD at 24 weeks. This study has 90% power to detect a 33% relative reduction in SCORAD between active and placebo groups, with 5% significance. Discussion: IgE may have a role to play in eczema, particularly in childhood. This forms the basis for the hypothesis that anti-IgE may be an effective treatment in this patient population. This will be the largest study to evaluate the efficacy of anti-IgE (omalizumab) versus placebo in children with severe eczema. The findings will help to clarify the role of anti-IgE as a potential treatment option in patients with severe childhood eczema.

There is therefore a need for low-cost, sub-1W, miniature non-isolated ac-dc down-converters. In this work, a new two-chip architecture is proposed to implement a high-voltage quasi-resonant buck converter with peak current-mode control. The current and voltage control loops are implemented in the high-side (HS) and low-side (LS) IC, respectively. Each IC includes a 700V power transistor, sensing and control circuits. The LS IC transmits the digital peak current command, along with mode selection information, to the HS IC using a low-power 20 MHz isolated communication interface. The architecture achieves a peak simulated efficiency of 85.6% when converting from 339 V to 12 V and allows the size of the input filter to be greatly reduced due to the current-mode operation. State-of-the- art UHV BCD technologies offer a unique opportunity to increase the level of integration and reduce the system cost in the targeted sensor node applications, despite the relatively poor figure-of-merit of the HV devices compared to discrete Silicon super-junction or GaN alternatives.
5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 Biomarkers; Imaging; Modulus; T2 mapping; MRI        	Non-invasive techniques for quantifying early biochemical and biomechanical changes in articular cartilage may provide a means of more precisely assessing osteoarthritis (OA) progression. The goals of this study were to determine the relationship between T1 rho magnetic resonance (MR) imaging relaxation times and changes in cartilage composition, cartilage mechanical properties, and synovial fluid biomarker levels and to demonstrate the application of T1rho imaging to evaluate cartilage composition in human subjects in vivo. Femoral condyles and synovial fluid were harvested from healthy and OA porcine knee joints. Sagittal T1rho relaxation MR images of the condyles were acquired. OA regions of OA joints exhibited an increase in T1rho relaxation times as compared to non-OA regions. Furthermore in these regions, cartilage sGAG content and aggregate modulus decreased, while percent degraded collagen and water content increased. In OA joints, synovial fluid concentrations of sGAG decreased and C2C concentrations increased compared to healthy joints. T1rho relaxation times were negatively correlated with cartilage and synovial fluid sGAG concentrations and aggregate modulus and positively correlated with water content and permeability. Additionally, we demonstrated the application of these in vitro findings to the study of human subjects. Specifically, we demonstrated that walking results in decreased T1rho relaxation times, consistent with water exudation and an increase in proteoglycan concentration with in vivo loading. Together, these findings demonstrate that cartilage MR imaging and synovial fluid biomarkers provide powerful non-invasive tools for characterizing changes in the biochemical and biomechanical environments of the joint.

5	39	111	Medical 	 Osteoarthritis  	 adjuvant; articular cartilage; Hedgehog signal pathway; temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis        	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in hedgehog (Hh) expression and its possible effects on cartilage degeneration in adjuvant-induced temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) of rats. METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into experimental osteoarthritis (OA) and sham control groups. The bilateral TMJs of six rats from each group were harvested at three, seven, 14, and 28 days. Histological changes in condylar cartilage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin, toluidine blue, and safranin O staining. The expression of Hh signal-related proteins including Indian hedgehog (Ihh), patched-1 (Ptch1), smoothened (Smo), glioma-associated oncogene homologue1 (Gli1) in cartilage was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), type X collagen, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5) in cartilage was evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: The histological analysis showed marked cartilage degeneration in adjuvant-induced OA groups, including reduced cartilage cellular density, thinner and degraded cartilage, and decreased proteoglycan content in the extracellular matrix. Compared with matched control groups, the expression of Ihh, Ptch1, Smo, and Gli1 in the OA groups was higher in a time-dependent manner. The protein levels of MMP-13, type X collagen, and ADAMTS-5 were substantially increased in OA cartilage compared with those in matched control rats. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the activation of Ihh signaling may be correlated with pathological changes of condylar cartilage in adjuvant-induced TMJOA.
5	24	96	Medical 	 Hepatitis C  	 Child-Pugh score; cirrhosis; liver stiffness; oesophageal varices; platelets count; portal hypertension        	Background & AimsThe 2015 Baveno VI guidelines recommend against performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with compensated cirrhosis who have a liver stiffness150000/mm(3) because of a low prevalence of varices at risk of bleeding in this population. The aim was to synthesize the available evidence on the usefulness of the combined use of liver stiffness and platelet count to identify patients without oesophageal varices. MethodsMeta-analysis of trials evaluating the usefulness of a given cut-off for liver stiffness and platelet count to rule out the presence of oesophageal varices. ResultsFifteen studies were included. All studies excepting five used the Baveno VI criteria. Compared to patients with either high liver stiffness or low platelet count, those with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count had a lower risk of varices at risk of bleeding (OR=0.22, 95% CI=0.13-0.39, P<.001) with low heterogeneity between studies (I-2=21%). They also had a lower risk of varices (OR=0.23, 95% CI=0.17-0.32, P<.001) with moderate heterogeneity between studies (I-2=28%). In patients with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count, the pooled estimate rates for varices at risk of bleeding was 0.040 (95% CI=0.027-0.059) with low heterogeneity between studies (I-2=3%). ConclusionsPatients with low liver stiffness and normal platelet count have a lower risk of varices than those with either high liver stiffness or low platelet count. Varices at risk of bleeding are found in no more than 4% of patients when liver stiffness is <20kPa and platelet count is normal.
5	41	113	Medical 	 Overactive Bladder  	 anticholinergic; overactive bladder; cognitive function        	Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of trospium chloride on cognitive function in postmenopausal women treated for overactive bladder (OAB). Methods: Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted from April 2013 to April 2015. Women aged 50 years or older seeking treatment for OAB were randomized to either trospium chloride XR 60 mg daily or placebo. Baseline cognitive function was assessed via Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Mini Mental Status Exam, Mini Mental Status X, Digit Span, Trails A, Trails B, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Cognitive function was reassessed at week 1 and week 4. A priori power analysis determined that 21 subjects were needed per group. Results: Although 59 women were enrolled and randomized (28 trospium and 31 placebo), 45 completed assessment (21 trospium and 24 placebo). Mean age was 68 years, 78% were white, and 44% had previously taken OAB medication. For the primary outcome, there was no difference in HVLT-R total score between trospium and placebo groups at week 4 (P = 0.29). There were also no differences based on the other cognitive tests. Therewas a correlation between age and the following week-4 tests: HVLT-R total score (r = -0.3, P = 0.02), HVLT-R total recall subscale (r = -0.4, P = 0.007), Trails A (r = 0.4, P = 0.002), and Trails B (r = 0.4, P = 0.004). A linear regression model found that HVLT-R total score decreased by 0.372 points for each increased year of age. Conclusions: In women aged 50 years and older, there were no changes in cognitive function between those taking trospium and placebo. Cognitive function was correlated with age.
2	14	47	Psychology  	 Child abuse  	 characteristics; child sexual abuse; intergenerational cycle; mothers; welfare services        	Considering the importance of mother's support in the adaptation of a sexually abused child, it is relevant to determine if the mothers and children involved in an intergenerational cycle of child sexual victimization differ from dyads in which only the child has been abused. The purpose of this study was to compare mother-child dyads with sexually abused children according to whether the mother had herself been victim of child sexual abuse. The sample included 87 dyads with sexually abused children aged 3-18years old and their mothers (44 reporting maternal and child abuse), followed by social welfare services of the province of Quebec (Canada). The two groups of mothers were compared on their past family abuse experiences and past family relations, their mental health history, their current psychological distress, their parenting behaviors, and their current levels of family functioning. Children were compared on their adaptation. Multivariate analyses indicated that mothers reporting child sexual abuse were more likely to report more other maltreatments in their childhood and greater prevalence of lifetime history of alcohol abuse disorders, dysthymia, and panic disorder compared with mothers who had not experienced CSA. Compared to children whose mothers had not experienced CSA, those whose mothers had experienced CSA showed higher rates of problems behaviors and were more likely to report having been sexually abused by a trusted person. These results highlight the specific clinical needs for the assessment and treatment for sexually abused children whose mothers experienced child sexual abuse.

We describe the case of a 15-year-old female patient with adverse reaction to aspirin, chronic rhinosinusitis, and severe asthma. She also experienced chronic idiopathic urticaria worsened by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration. AERD was diagnosed based on clinical history and symptoms. Given the poor responsiveness to standard therapy for respiratory and cutaneous symptoms, omalizumab was administered for 24 weeks with control of respiratory symptoms and short term improvement of cutaneous symptoms.

5	31	103	Medical 	 Low Testosterone  	 Varicocele; Hypogonadism; Low testosterone; Microsurgical varicocelectomy; Subinguinal varicocele repair; Leydig cell function        	Accumulating evidence suggests that varicocele, long associated with male infertility, is also a risk factor for low testosterone levels. The exact pathophysiology of the negative effects of varicocele on testicular function is not well understood, but theories include venous stasis, increased testicular temperature, oxidative stress, and resulting toxic environment. While prior studies report conflicting effects of nonmicrosurgical varicocelectomy on testosterone level, recent literature demonstrates that microsurgical varicocelectomy improves testosterone levels in men with varicocele and low testosterone preoperatively.
6	5	130	biochemistry 	 Enzymology  	 endo-1   4-beta-Glucanase; Cellulase; Assay procedure; 2-Chloro-4-nitrophenyl; Colourimetric; Oligosaccharides       	A specific and sensitive substrate for the assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (cellulase) has been prepared. The substrate mixture comprises benzylidene end-blocked 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-cellotrioside (BzCNPG3) in the presence of thermostable beta-glucosidase. Hydrolysis by exo-acting enzymes such as beta-glucosidase and exo-beta-glucanase is prevented by the presence of the benzylidene group on the non-reducing end D-glucosyl residue. On hydrolysis by cellulase, the 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-beta-glycoside is immediately hydrolysed to 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol and free D-glucose by the b-glucosidase in the substrate mixture. The reaction is terminated and colour developed by the addition of a weak alkaline solution. The assay procedure is simple to use, specific, accurate, robust and readily adapted to automation. This procedure should find widespread applications in biomass enzymology and in the specific assay of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase in general. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	2	74	Medical 	 Alzheimer's Disease  	 protein electrostatics; drug design; molecular dynamics; protein-ligand binding; Alzheimer's disease; protease        	BACE1 is a major therapeutic target for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Developing inhibitors that can selectively target BACE1 in favor of other proteases, especially cathepsin D (CatD), has presented significant challenges. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics and protonation states of BACE1 and CatD using continuous constant pH molecular dynamics with pH replica-exchange sampling protocol. Despite similar structure, BACE1 and CatD exhibit markedly different active site dynamics. BACE1 displays pH-dependent flap dynamics that controls substrate accessibility, while the CatD flap is relatively rigid and remains open in the pH range 2.5-6. Interestingly, although each protease hydrolyzes peptide bonds, the protonation states of the catalytic dyads are different within the active pH range. The acidic and basic components of the BACE1 catalytic dyad are clear, while either aspartic acid of the CatD catalytic dyad could play the role of acid or base. Finally, we investigate binding of the inhibitor LY2811376 developed by Eli Lilly to BACE1 and CatD. Surprisingly, in the enzyme active pH range, LY2811376 forms a stronger salt bridge with the catalytic dyad in CatD than in BACE1, which might explain the retinal toxicity of the inhibitor related to off-target inhibition of CatD. This work highlights the complexity and challenge in structure-based drug design where receptor-ligand binding induces protonation state change in both the protein and the inhibitor.

5	43	115	Medical 	 Parkinson's Disease  	 ER-associated degradation; GPR37; LRP6; PAEL-R; Wnt signaling        	Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a key role in embryonic development, stem cell biology, and neurogenesis. However, the mechanisms of Wnt signal transmission, notably how the receptors are regulated, remain incompletely understood. Here we describe that the Parkinson's disease-associated receptor GPR37 functions in the maturation of the N-terminal bulky beta-propellers of the Wnt co-receptor LRP6. GPR37 is required for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and protects LRP6 from ER-associated degradation via CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) and the ATPase VCP. GPR37 is highly expressed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) where it is required for Wnt-dependent neurogenesis. We conclude that GPR37 is crucial for cellular protein quality control during Wnt signaling.
6	7	132	biochemistry 	 Northern blotting  	 Trehalase; Cloning; Characterization; Expression pattern; Spodoptera litura        	The oriental leafworm moth, Spodoptera litura, is a major agricultural pest in southeast Asia and nearby Pacific regions. Two distinct trehalases have been identified in insects: soluble trehalase (Treh1) and membrane-bound trehalase (Treh2), although there is currently no information on these genes in S. litura. To characterize the distribution and function of treh, cDNAs of Treh proteins were cloned from S. litura. SpoliTreh1 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1758 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 585 amino acids, with a predicted mass of approximately 67.07 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.86. SpoliTreh2 cDNA has an open reading frame of 2325 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 645 amino acids, a mass of approximately 73.62 kDa, and an isoelectric point of 5.90. Northern blotting analysis revealed that SpoliTreh1 transcripts are in the midgut, fat body, tracheae, and epidermis, but not in the brain and Malpighian tubules of S. litura larvae, whereas SpoliTreh2 transcripts were found in all 6 tissues. SpoliTreh1 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body the pre-pupal stage, and SpoliTreh2 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body of 3-day-old larvae of the 6th instar and during the 1st 6 days of the pupal stage, except the 2nd day. Both SpoliTreh1 and SpoliTreh2 were highly expressed in third-instar larvae.
6	8	133	biochemistry 	 Southern blotting  	 Embryonic stem cells; Genome engineering; Knockout; MLPA; Mouse model        	Following locus-specific genome editing of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the identification of correctly targeted clones remains a challenge. We applied multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for homologous recombination-based genomic integration of a knockout construct in which part of a gene is deleted. All candidate ESCs thereby identified were subsequently validated by conventional methods. Thus, MLPA represents a highly reliable as well as cost- and time-efficient alternative to currently applied methods such as Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches. It is also applicable to knockin recombination strategies and compatible with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and other genome editing strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 Urban hydrology; Water mass balance; Water efficiency; Water-related energy; Wastewater recycling; Stormwater        	Urban areas will need to pursue new water servicing options to ensure local supply security. Decisions about how best to employ them are not straightforward due to multiple considerations and the potential for problem shifting among them. We hypothesise that urban water metabolism evaluation based a water mass balance can help address this, and explore the utility of this perspective and the new insights it provides about water servicing options. Using a water mass balance evaluation framework, which considers direct urban water flows (both 'natural' hydrological and 'anthropogenic' flows), as well as water-related energy, we evaluated how the use of alternative water sources (stormwater/rainwater harvesting, wastewater/greywater recycling) at different scales influences the 'local water metabolism' of a case study urban development. New indicators were devised to represent the water-related 'resource efficiency' and 'hydrological performance' of the urban area. The new insights gained were the extent to which alternative water supplies influence the water efficiency and hydrological performance of the urban area, and the potential energy trade-offs. The novel contribution is the development of new indicators of urban water resource performance that bring together considerations of both the 'anthropogenic' and 'natural' water cycles, and the interactions between them. These are used for the first time to test alternative water servicing scenarios, and to provide a new perspective to complement broader sustainability assessments of urban water.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 drug therapy; endometrial cancer; treatment        	Purpose of review Endometrial cancer incidence is increasing in North America and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women. We review recent literature published on treatment of endometrial cancer and highlight areas of active interest. Recent findings There has been movement toward minimal invasive surgery at diagnosis; lymph node staging remains controversial and continues to be investigated. Progress has been made to establish consensus on endometrial cancer risk classification to promote consistency for future trial design. Molecular characterization of endometrial cancer and its integration into clinicopathological profiling to develop predictive biomarkers for treatment selection are active areas of research. Optimal adjuvant treatment strategy in high-risk endometrial cancer remains to be defined with recognition of treatment-related toxicity. Despite encouraging results in drug development for treatment of advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer, no targeted therapies beyond hormonal therapy are approved. There is an urgent need for scientifically validated therapy with predictive biomarkers. Summary Our understanding of endometrial cancer has evolved through improvements in molecular biology, allowing improved definition of target-specific therapies. The precise role and sequence of conventional and targeted therapies, including immunotherapy, will require careful attention to the design of clinical trials with translational emphasis to allow the discovery, validation, and implementation of predictive biomarkers into clinical care.
5	23	95	Medical 	 Heart Disease  	 abdominal obesity; epidemiology; Iran; metabolic syndrome; prevalence        	BackgroundThe aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its individual components among the Iranian adult population in 2011 and to investigate changes between 2007 and 2011. MethodsData from two rounds of the Surveillance of Risk Factors of Non-communicable Diseases national surveys conducted in 2007 and 2011 were pooled. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to International Diabetes Federation criteria. ResultsIn 2007, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome among adults aged 25-64 years was 35.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.27-37.63), which decreased to 32.96 (95% CI 30.73-35.18) in 2011 (P = 0.0108). Despite this overall decline, the prevalence of central obesity (P = 0.1383), raised triglycerides (P = 0.3058), and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; P = 0.5595) remained constant. There was a trend towards a decline in the proportion of individuals with increased blood pressure (P = 0.0978), and the proportion of adults with increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG) increased (P < 0.0001). In 2011, the prevalence of central obesity, raised triglycerides, reduced HDL-C, increased blood pressure and increased FPG was 51.88 (95% CI 48.97-54.79), 36.99 (95% CI 34.52-39.45), 54.72 (95% CI 50.87-58.57), 38.92 (95% CI 36.19-41.64), and 24.97 (95% CI 22.02-27.93) respectively. ConclusionsOver the period 2007-11, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome has decreased slightly in Iran, although prevalence of increased FPG has increased significantly. One-third of the Iranian adult population is diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.
2	14	47	Psychology  	 Child abuse  	 child abuse; mental health; mental disorders; well-being; functioning; suicidal ideation; resilience; intervention; coping; physical activity        	Objective: Child abuse can have devastating mental health consequences. Fortunately, not all individuals exposed to child abuse will suffer from poor mental health. Understanding what factors are related to good mental health following child abuse can provide evidence to inform prevention of impairment. Our objectives were to 1) describe the prevalence of good, moderate, and poor mental health among respondents with and without a child abuse history; 2) examine the relationships between child abuse and good, moderate, and poor mental health outcomes; 3) examine the relationships between individual- and relationship-level factors and better mental health outcomes; and 4) determine if individual- and relationship-level factors moderate the relationship between child abuse and mental health. Method: Data were from the nationally representative 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health (n = 23,395; household response rate = 79.8%; 18 years and older). Good, moderate, and poor mental health was assessed using current functioning and well-being, past-year mental disorders, and past-year suicidal ideation. Results: Only 56.3% of respondents with a child abuse history report good mental health compared to 72.4% of those without a child abuse history. Individual- and relationship-level factors associated with better mental health included higher education and income, physical activity, good coping skills to handle problems and daily demands, and supportive relationships that foster attachment, guidance, reliable alliance, social integration, and reassurance of worth. Conclusions: This study identifies several individual- and relationship-level factors that could be targeted for intervention strategies aimed at improving mental health outcomes following child abuse.

In collaboration, 3DVW are used with good results due to features such as immersion, interaction capabilities, use of avatar embodiment, and physical space. In the particular cases of avatar embodiment and physical space, these features support nonverbal communication, but its impact on collaboration is not well known. In this work we present the initial steps for creation of a protocol for case study research, aiming to assert itself as a tool to collect data on how nonverbal communication influences collaboration in 3DVW. We define the propositions and units of analysis, and a pilot case to validate them.
6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 Antibiotics; Flavin analogs; Human flavokinase; Human FAD synthetase; Streptomyces davawensis        	The non-pathogenic Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces davawensis synthesizes the riboflavin (vitamin B(2)) analogs roseoflavin (RoF) and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin (AF). Both compounds are antibiotics. Notably, a number of other riboflavin analogs are currently under investigation with regard to the development of novel antiinfectives. As a first step towards understanding the metabolism of riboflavin analogs in humans, the key enzymes flavokinase (EC 2.7.1.26) and FAD synthetase (EC 2.7.7.2) were studied. Human flavokinase efficiently converted RoF and AF to roseoflavin mononucleotide (RoFMN) and 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin mononucleotide (AFMN), respectively. Human FAD synthetase accepted RoFMN but not AFMN as a substrate. Consequently, roseoflavin adenine dinucleotide (RoFAD) was synthesized by the latter enzyme but not 8-demethyl-8-amino-riboflavin adenine dinucleotide (AFAD). The cofactor analogs RoFMN, AFMN and RoFAD have different physicochemical properties as compared to FMN and FAD. Thus, the cofactor analogs have the potential to render flavoenzymes inactive, which may negatively affect human metabolism. RoF, but not AF, was found to inhibit human flavokinase. In summary, we suggest that AF has a lower toxic potential and may be better suited as a lead structure to develop antimicrobial compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

5	37	109	Medical 	 Myelofibrosis  	 polycythemia vera; quality of life; signs and symptoms        	Objectives: Polycythemia vera (PV)-related symptoms may not be adequately controlled with conventional therapy. This current analysis of the RESPONSE trial evaluated the effects of ruxolitinib compared with standard therapy on quality of life (QoL) and symptoms in patients with PV who were hydroxyurea resistant/intolerant. Methods: In the previously reported primary analysis, ruxolitinib achieved the primary composite endpoint of hematocrit control and >= 35% reduction in spleen volume at Week 32. The current analysis evaluated patient-reported outcomes using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF), the Pruritus Symptom Impact Scale (PSIS), and the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). Results: Compared with standard therapy, ruxolitinib was associated with greater improvements in global health status/QoL, functional subscales, and individual symptom scores of the EORTC QLQ-C30. At Week 32, more patients in the ruxolitinib arm (44%) achieved a >= 10-point improvement in global health status/QoL vs. standard therapy (9%). Improvements in MPN-SAF symptom scores were consistent with improvements in EORTC QLQ-C30, PSIS, and PGIC scores. Conclusions: Ruxolitinib provides clinically relevant improvements in QoL and ameliorates symptom burden in patients with PV who are hydroxyurea resistant/intolerant.
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 frequency analysis; impedance method; digital control system; grid-connected inverter; sinusoidal compensator        	A grid-connected inverter is indispensable for photovoltaic power generation and smart grid systems, and it must be designed for stable operation. The impedance method based on the Nyquist criterion is often utilized to analyze the stability of grid-connected inverter systems. The impedance method is based on the eigenvalues of the product of the inverter output admittance and the line impedance matrices in the frequency domain. However, the frequency characteristics have so far been derived only for inverters with analog control systems. A new frequency analysis method for inverters with digital control systems is proposed in this paper. First, a stability analysis example for a three-phase LCL-type inverter controlled digitally is shown and the results are compared and validated with those by simulation using a Saber simulator. Finally, they are also compared and validated with experimental results digitally controlled by a DSP-based system. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

1	1	18	ECE 	 Lorentz force law  	 Energy harvester; TPMS        	This paper proposes the design of a novel weighted-rotor energy harvester, which oscillates due to the periodic change of the tangential component of gravity, to harvest kinetic energy from a rotating wheel. Unlike traditional energy-harvesting devices, which have a fixed natural frequency, when the speed of the car increases, the centripetal acceleration of the rotating wheel also increases the rotor's natural frequency of oscillation. By employing a suitably-designed weight, the natural frequency of the rotor can match with the rotating frequency of the wheel at any speed, and the rotor oscillates at a large angle and angular velocity to generate a large amount of power. The models of power generation were derived by using Faraday's law of induction and Lorentz force law, which were followed by the numerical simulation performed to verify the correctness with experiments. The output voltage and power have been discussed considering the constant and accelerating plate rotation speed. When a 550 ohm resistor connected in series, the average output power is 399 to 535 micro-Watts at plate rotation speed from 300 to 500 rpm and is possible to be the power source for TPMS.
4	2	63	Civil 	 Remote Sensing  	 coastline change; spatio-temporal pattern; Ningbo; Landsat; normalized difference water index        	Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province is one of the largest port cities in China and has achieved high economic development during the past decades. The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Immunology; cardiology        	Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a heart failure syndrome occurring late in pregnancy or during the early post-natal period. The pathophysiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy is not fully understood and various mechanisms have been postulated including an underlying inflammatory process. We here report four cases presenting with acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three out of four of the patients presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and one with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. All made a full clinical recovery following treatment with high-dose intravenous steroids. This case series adds to the growing body of evidence for the role for immunosuppressants in the management of peripartum cardiomyopathy.
5	14	86	Medical 	 Dementia  	 hearing loss; dementia; screening; elderly        	ObjectivesTo develop a version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to be administered to the severely hearing impaired (HI-MoCA), and to assess its performance in two groups of cognitively intact adults over the age of 60. Study TypeTest development followed by prospective subject recruitment. MethodsThe MoCA was converted into a timed PowerPoint (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) presentation, and verbal instructions were converted into visual instructions. Two groups of subjects over the age of 60 were recruited. All subjects passed screening questionnaires to eliminate those with undiagnosed mild cognitive impairment. The first group had normal hearing (group 1). The second group was severely hearing impaired (group 2). Group 1 received either the MoCA or HI-MoCA test (T1). Six months later (T2), subjects were administered the test (MoCA or HI-MoCA) they had not received previously to determine equivalency. Group 2 received the HI-MoCA at T1 and again at T2 to determine test-retest reliability. ResultsOne hundred and three subjects were recruited into group 1, with a score of 26.66 (HI-MoCA) versus 27.14 (MoCA). This was significant (P0.05), with a test-retest coefficient of 0.66. ConclusionThe HI-MoCA is easy to administer and reliable for screening cognitive impairment in the severely hearing impaired. No conversion factor is required in our prospectively tested cohort of cognitively intact subjects. Level of Evidence1b. Laryngoscope, 127:S4-S11, 2017
2	3	36	Psychology  	 Nonverbal communication  	 annotation tools; interaction analysis; human motion visualization        	The qualitative analysis of nonverbal communication is more and more relying on 3D recording technology. However, the human analysis of 3D data on a regular 2D screen can be challenging as 3D scenes are difficult to visually parse. To optimally exploit the full depth of the 3D data, we propose to enhance the 3D view with a number of visualizations that clarify spatial and conceptual relationships and add derived data like speed and angles. In this paper, we present visualizations for directional body motion, hand movement direction, gesture space location, and proxemic dimensions like interpersonal distance, movement and orientation. The proposed visualizations are available in the open source tool JMocap and are planned to be fully integrated into the ANVIL video annotation tool. The described techniques are intended to make annotation more efficient and reliable and may allow the discovery of entirely new phenomena.

0	16	16	CS 	 Bioinformatics  	 cervical cancer; differentially-expressed genes; differentially-expressed microRNAs; protein-protein interaction; enrichment analysis        	Cervical cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. In order to identify the microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) and mRNAs associated with the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cervical cancer, an miRNA microarray, GSE30656, and 3 mRNA microarrays, GSE63514, GSE39001 and GSE9750, for cervical cancer were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus. These datasets were analyzed in order to obtain differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs using the GEO2R tool. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis for DEGs were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis for DEGs was conducted using The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes software and visualized using Cytoscape, followed by hub gene identification, and biological process and pathway enrichment analysis of the module selected from the PPI network using the Molecular Complex Detection plugin. In addition, miRecords was applied to predict the targets of differentially-expressed miRNAs. A total of 44 DEGs and 15 differentially-expressed miRNAs were identified. These DEGs were mainly enriched in GO terms associated with the cell cycle. In the PPI network, cyclin-dependent kinase 1, topoisomerase DNA II alpha, aurora kinase A (AURKA) and minichromosome maintenance complex component 2 (MCM2) had higher degrees of connectivity. A significant module was detected from the PPI network. AURKA, MCM2 and kinesin family member 20A exhibited higher degrees in this module, while the genes in the module were mainly involved in the cell cycle and the DNA replication pathway. In addition, estrogen receptor 1 was predicted as the potential target of 13 miRNAs. A total of 10 DEGs were identified as potential targets of miR-203. In conclusion, the results indicated that microarray dataset analysis may provide a useful method for the identification of key genes and patterns to successfully identify determinants of the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer. The functional studies of candidate genes and miRNAs from these databases may lead to an increased understanding of the development of cervical cancer.
1	4	21	ECE 	 Digital control  	 Polling; semi-Markov process; recursive procedure; expectation; dispersion; time interval        	An ergodic semi-Markov process with the structure represented by the full graph with loops, which simulates a digital control algorithm that generated transactions onto an object, is investigated. Elementary simplifications for reduction of semi-Markov processes are defined. Recursive procedure for reduction of initial semi-Markov process structure till the model, which includes selected states with its links only, is proposed. Formulae for recalculation of probabilities, weighted densities and expectations of time of switching to linked states are obtained. It is shown that recursive procedure may be used also for calculation of time expectation of return the process to one of selected states that simplified the task of evaluation of time intervals between transactions in polling procedure.
2	7	40	Psychology  	 Depression  	 Addictive behaviours; Craving; Desire thinking; Metacognitions; Metacognitive theory; Internet pornography use        	Defined as sexually explicit material that elicits erotic thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, internet pornography is a prevalent form of media that may facilitate problematic use and craving for engagement. Research suggests that superordinate cognitions and information processing, such as desire thinking and metacognition, are central to the activation and escalation of craving in addictive behaviours. The current study aimed to contribute to the literature by testing the proposed metacognitive model of desire thinking and craving in a sample of problematic pornography users, while revising the model by incorporating negative affect. From a theoretical perspective, environmental cues trigger positive metacognitions about desire thinking that directly influence desire thinking, resulting in the escalation of craving, negative metacognitions, and negative affect. Participants were recruited via an online survey and screened for problematic internet pornography use. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among the aforementioned constructs in a final sample of 191 participants. Consistent with previous research, results of this study validated the existence of metacognitive processes in the activation of desire thinking and escalation of craving, while indicating that desire thinking has the potential to influence negative affect. Additionally, results supported the role of significant indirect relationships between constructs within the revised model of metacognition, desire thinking, and psychopathology. Collectively, the findings demonstrate the clinical value of a metacognitive conceptualisation of problematic pornography use. Exploring the metacognitive mechanisms that underpin problematic internet pornography use may give rise to the development of new treatment and relapse prevention strategies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 aggression; music; misogynous; men-hating; media violence        	Three studies examined the impact of sexual-aggressive song lyrics on aggressive thoughts, emotions, and behavior toward the same and the opposite sex. In Study 1, the authors directly manipulated whether male or female participants listened to misogynous or neutral song lyrics and measured actual aggressive behavior. Male participants who were exposed to misogynous song lyrics administered more hot chili sauce to a female than to a male confederate. Study 2 shed some light on the underlying psychological processes: Male participants who heard misogynous song lyrics recalled more negative attributes Of women and reported more feelings of vengeance than when they heard neutral song lyrics. In addition, men-hating song lyrics had a similar effect on aggression-related responses of female participants toward men. Finally, Study 3 replicated the findings of the previous two studies with an alternative measure of aggressive behavior as well as a more subtle measure of aggressive cognitions. The results are discussed in the framework of the General Aggression Model.
0	2	2	CS 	 network security  	 Cyber switching attack; SG security and SG stability; thyristor-controlled braking resistor        	As the conventional power systems turn towards smart grids (SGs) on a fast pace, this transition may create new and significant challenges to the existing electrical network security. Along with many important features of the SGs cyber security has emerged to be a critical issue due to the interconnection of several loads, generators, and renewable resources through the communication network. Cyber-physical attacks (CPAs) are classified as the major threatening of SGs security because it may lead to severe consequences such as large blackout and destruction of infrastructures. Cyber switching attacks (CSAs) (as a part CPAs) start to attract the attention due to its severity and speed in destabilizing the SGs, we present in this paper Thyristor-Controlled Braking Resistor (TCBR) as a solution to mitigate this type of attack. TCBR can enable us to stabilize the target generator in a relatively short time.
0	13	13	CS 	 Algorithm design  	 Discrete-time system; CSTR control; Adaptive control; The neural networks; Nonlinear systems        	In this paper, an adaptive predictive control algorithm is employed to controlling a class of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. The main contribute of this paper is that the CSTR system are in discrete-time form and non-symmetric dead-zone inputs are considered here. The design parameters of control algorithm for the CSTR systems are not so much than before, such that the calculated amount of the control algorithm is less than before. By considering the Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), the unknown functions are approximated, the mean value theorem is utilized in the algorithm design process. Based on the Lyapunov analysis method, and choosing the design parameters appropriately, all the signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) and the tracking error is converged to a small compact set. A simulation example for CSTR systems is studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 photovoltaic modules; two-diode equivalent circuit; I-V characteristics; solar energy        	Many diode-based equivalent circuits for simulating the electrical behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) cells and panels are reported in the scientific literature. Two-diode equivalent circuits, which require more complex procedures to calculate the seven model parameters, are less numerous. The model parameters are generally calculated using the data extracted from the datasheets issued by the PV panel manufactures and adopting simplifying hypotheses and numerical solving techniques. A criterion for rating both the usability and accuracy of two-diode models is proposed in this paper with the aim of supporting researchers and designers, working in the area of PV systems, to select and use a model that may be fit for purpose. The criterion adopts a three-level rating scale that considers the ease of finding the data used by the analytical procedure, the simplicity of the mathematical tools needed to perform calculations and the accuracy achieved in calculating the current and power. The analytical procedures, the simplifying hypotheses and the operative steps to calculate the parameters of the most famous two-diode equivalent circuits are exhaustively described in this paper. The accuracy of the models is tested by comparing the characteristics issued by the PV panel manufacturers with the current-voltage (I-V) curves, at constant solar irradiance and/or cell temperature, calculated with the analysed models with. The results of the study show that the two-diode models recently proposed reach accuracies that are comparable with the values derived from the one-diode models.

However, evidence is lacking regarding the role of intermittent fasting. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a Ramadan model of intermittent fasting (RIF; 14 h of daytime abstinence from food and drinking) for 28 d on body composition, glucose metabolism, and cognitive function. Methods: Ten healthy, lean men were included in a nonrandomized, crossover, intervention study. Testing was performed before a control period of 28 d, as well as before and after 28 d of RIF. Whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, fitness test, oral glucose tolerance test, and cognitive function tests were performed. As secondary outcome, the participants' physical activity and 72-h glycemic responses were monitored 6 d within each of the periods. Dietary intake, appetite, and mood questionnaires also were assessed. Results: Comparing A differences from testing days; body mass index changes from the control period (A Mean: 02 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 0.5) and the RIF period (A mean: 03 kg/m2, 95% CI,-0.6 to-0.1) were significantly different (P < 0.05). Secondary outcomes within the RIF period showed an increased area under curve (AUC) for hunger accompanied by a reduced AUC for satiety (both, P < 0.05), less mean steps per day (P < 0.05), and less positive feelings in the afternoon (P < 0.01) compared with the control period. No changes were observed in any of the other evaluated parameters. Conclusions: Free-living participants were able to comply with 14 h of daily daytime abstinence from food and drinking for 28 d with only a minor effect on body mass index and without any effects on body composition, glucose metabolism, and cognitive function.

6	6	131	biochemistry 	 Polymerase chain reaction  	 CML; BCR-ABL; mutation; imatinib; nilotinib        	Introduction: The identification of BCR-ABL expression as the defining leukemogenic event in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the introduction of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in 2001 have revolutionized disease management, leading to a reduction in mortality rates and accordingly an increase in the estimated prevalence of CML. Case report : Based on medical records and clinical follow-up, the authors present the case of a Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML patient who developed resistance to imatinib. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing revealed a V280G BCR-ABL mutation. Discussion and conclusions: This is the first report describing a new BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation-V280G-that might be associated with resistance to imatinib. Approximately 15% to 30% of patients treated with imatinib discontinue treatment due to resistance or intolerance. More than 90 BCR-ABL mutations were detected so far, conferring variable degrees of drug resistance, with consequent clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic impact.
2	12	45	Psychology  	 Media violence  	 media violence; behavioral effects; violent entertainment; crime and media        	This review of empirical research into the effects of media violence examines what has been learned from evidence and to what extent the evidence can be accepted at face value. This article reexamines debates about different data types, different methodologies, theoretical and explanatory models, directions of effect, and value of aggregated data sets. Limitations and weaknesses are identified in relation to the various methodological approaches and sources of evidence that have been featured in academic discussions and debates about media policy and content regulation. Although not dismissing the empirical research on this subject as valueless, this critique advises caution in accepting blanket conclusions about harmful effects of media violence, instead calling for a targeted approach that recognizes that some media consumers may be more susceptible than others to media effects and that media depictions of violence can vary in the risks they represent as potential triggers of unpleasant or harmful reactions among media consumers.
1	13	30	ECE 	 State space representation  	 switch-mode converter; non-linear state-space modeling; feedback control        	In this paper, the development of a novel controller for a bidirectional buck and boost converter is studied to implement an active capacitance. To this end, an averaging method is used to obtain a nonlinear state-space model of the converter in the Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) for buck and boost configurations, separately. These models are then combined into a state-space representation for the whole range of operation. Using the obtained model, a controller is designed to track a desired input current based on the applied input voltage such that the circuit exhibits a capacitive effect between the input terminals. The converter along with its proposed control method is a suitable replacement for the commonly used electrolytic capacitors in different applications. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate performance of the proposed current control method. Experimental verification is currently under investigation.

In order for proteins to maintain their functionality in both the parent cell and subsequent generations, it is essential that the information encoded in DNA and RNA remains unaltered. DNA and RNA are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can modify nucleic acids and change the information they encode. While much is known about how cells respond to damaged DNA, the importance of protecting RNA has only become appreciated over the past decade. Modification of the nucleobase through oxidation and alkylation has long been known to affect its base-pairing properties during DNA replication. Similarly, recent studies have begun to highlight some of the unwanted consequences of chemical damage on mRNA decoding during translation. Oxidation and alkylation of mRNA appear to have drastic effects on the speed and fidelity of protein synthesis. As some mRNAs can persist for days in certain tissues, it is not surprising that it has recently emerged that mRNA-surveillance and RNA-repair pathways have evolved to clear or correct damaged mRNA."
5	6	78	Medical 	 Atopic Dermatitis  	 allergic contact dermatitis; atopic dermatitis; children; contact allergy; contact dermatitis; delayed-type hypersensitivity; patch testing        	Background. Allergic contact dermatitis is known to occur in children with and without atopic dermatitis, but more data are needed on contact sensitization profiles in these two groups. Objectives. To identify frequent allergens in children with and without atopic dermatitis suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis. Methods. A retrospective analysis of children aged 0-17 years patch tested between 1996 and 2013 was performed. Results. Of all 1012 children tested because of suspected contact dermatitis, 46% developed one or more positive reactions, the proportions for children with (n= 526) and without (n= 395) atopic dermatitis being 48% and 47%, respectively. Children with atopic dermatitis reacted more often to lanolin alcohol (30% pet., p= 0.030), Amerchol L-101 (p= 0.030), and fragrances [ fragrance mix I (p= 0.048) and Myroxylon pereirae (p= 0.005)]. Allergens outside the European baseline series that frequently gave positive reactions in these groups included cocamidopropyl betaine and Amerchol L-101. Reactivity to these allergens was significantly more common in atopic dermatitis children. Conclusion. Sensitization prevalences in children with and without atopic dermatitis were similar, but children with atopic dermatitis reacted significantly more often to lanolin alcohol and fragrances. Testing with additional series besides the European baseline series may be necessary, as reactions to, for example, cocamidopropyl betaine and Amerchol L-101 may otherwise be missed.

4	2	63	Civil 	 Remote Sensing  	 Landscape mapping; Time series; Local spatial indicator; Modified Mann-Kendall test; Vegetation; Built-up areas        	Urbanization is a natural and social process involving simultaneous changes to the Earth's land systems, energy flow, demographics, and the economy. Understanding the spatiotemporal pattern of urbanization is increasingly important for policy formulation, decision making, and natural resource management. A combination of satellite remote sensing and patch-based models has been widely adopted to characterize landscape changes at various spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the validity of this type of framework in identifying long-term changes, especially subtle or gradual land modifications is seriously challenged. In this paper, we integrate annual image time series, continuous spatial indices, and non-parametric trend analysis into a spatiotemporal study of landscape dynamics over the Phoenix metropolitan area from 1991 to 2010. We harness local indicators of spatial dependence and modified Mann-Kendall test to describe the monotonic trends in the quantity and spatial arrangement of two important land use land cover types: vegetation and built-up areas. Results suggest that declines in vegetation and increases in built-up areas are the two prevalent types of changes across the region. Vegetation increases mostly occur at the outskirts where new residential areas are developed from natural desert. A sizable proportion of vegetation declines and built-up increases are seen in the central and southeast part. Extensive land conversion from agricultural fields into urban land use is one important driver of vegetation declines. The xeriscaping, practice also contributes to part of vegetation loss and an increasingly heterogeneous landscape. The quantitative framework proposed in this study provides a pathway to effective landscape mapping and change monitoring from a spatial statistical perspective.

Thirty CD patients without previous bowel surgery underwent DWI-MRE (b = 900 sec/mm(2)) before and after intravenous Buscopan. The 30 patients were randomly divided into two groups; using a crossover design, interpretations were made regarding the presence of restricted mural diffusion (i.e., bowel inflammation) in nine bowel segments in two separate reading sessions by two readers. The readers also judged restricted mural diffusion extent in each bowel segment on two side-by-side DWI-MRE images with a random right-to-left order. Ileocolonoscopy and conventional MRE interpreted by an expert panel were reference standards. We analyzed 262 bowel segments. DWI-MRE without Buscopan significantly decreased sensitivity for both readers (58.8 % vs. 72.9 %, P = 0.046; 57.6 % vs. 85.9 %, P = 0.001) and did not significantly increase specificity (P = 0.085 and 0.396). Two readers noted that 28.6 % and 23.3 % of 262 bowel segments had greater diffusion restriction extent on DWI-MRE with Buscopan compared with DWI-MRE without Buscopan (P < 0.001) and 68.7 % and 74 %, respectively, had similar extent between them. Omitting Buscopan caused a greater loss in sensitivity of DWI-MRE than false-positive reduction for diagnosing bowel inflammation in CD. aEuro cent Omitting Buscopan significantly decreases DWI-MRE sensitivity for diagnosing bowel inflammation in CD. aEuro cent Increase in the corresponding DWI-MRE specificity by omitting Buscopan is less apparent. aEuro cent DWI-MRE without Buscopan underestimates the extent of bowel inflammation in CD.

A recently presented counter-model, the rotation to complex structure supported by a large number of investigations fundamentally calls this assumption into question. This paper examines the claimed advantage of a rotation to complex structure with the aid of artificially generated data structures whose components were predetermined. For similarity comparisons, it has been possible to show that only a rotation to complex structure provides interpretable and realistic solutions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0	14	14	CS 	 Computer programming  	 blended learning; OJ; online judge; programming        	There is a lot of emphasis on theoretical education rather than practical ability training, in programming courses at colleges and universities, giving rise to low programming ability for students, which has a severe impact on their professional development. Automatic judgement-based online judge system is both suitable for exploration learning and for collaborative learning. This paper uses the principle of blended learning and proposes a set of blended learning modes which combine online judge with computer programming courses. The paper first describes design ideas of the blended learning mode in a learning environment, resource, learning content and form and learning evaluation. Then the author takes C programming language course as an example to elaborate practical measures of the blended learning. Finally, the comparative experiments show that the application of the mode has improved significantly in the knowledge points, the amount of code and test scores of students than traditional methods. The application of the blended learning model based on an online judge system in programming courses plays a positive role to students' programming, logical thinking, research and innovation capabilities.
4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 ambient; machine to machine communication; intelligent system        	Ambient Intelligence is the vision of future in which environments support the people living in them. This environment is self-effacing, interconnected, adaptable, dynamic, embedded, and intelligent. The vision is to disappear the technology instead processors and sensors are integrated in everyday objects. To develop such an environment wherein technology is invisible to the user and environment directly communicates with the user. A completely interactive environment that could assists the users in every possible manner. In order to design and develop such an environment, there is a need to shift technology from machine to human communication to machine to machine communication (M2M). For such communication there is the requirement of real time data, energy and the decision making concepts which are considered as the main objectives that needs to be fulfilled. In this paper we present the major contribution of various researchers in this field. Further we have also discussed the major challenges and risks associated with such intelligent environment and a methodology to overcome with the challenges in AmI environment.
6	1	126	biochemistry 	 Cell biology  	 imaging techniques; endocytosis; TIRF microscopy; Arabidopsis; plants; trafficking        	Endocytosis is a key process in the internalization of extracellular materials and plasma membrane proteins, such as receptors and transporters, thereby controlling many aspects of cell signaling and cellular homeostasis. Endocytosis in plants has an essential role not only for basic cellular functions but also for growth and development, nutrient delivery, toxin avoidance, and pathogen defense. The precise mechanisms of endocytosis in plants remain quite elusive. The lack of direct visualization and examination of single events of endocytosis has greatly hampered our ability to precisely monitor the cell surface lifetime and the recruitment profile of proteins driving endocytosis or endocytosed cargos in plants. Here, we discuss the necessity to systematically implement total internal reflection fluorescence microcopy (TIRF) in the Plant Cell Biology community and present reliable protocols for high spatial and temporal imaging of endocytosis in plants using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a test case, since it represents the major route for internalization of cell-surface proteins in plants. We developed a robust method to directly visualize cell surface proteins using TIRF microscopy combined to a high throughput, automated and unbiased analysis pipeline to determine the temporal recruitment profile of proteins to single sites of endocytosis, using the departure of clathrin as a physiological reference for scission. Using this 'departure assay', we assessed the recruitment of two different AP-2 subunits, alpha and mu, to the sites of endocytosis and found that AP2A1 was recruited in concert with clathrin, while AP2M was not. This validated approach therefore offers a powerful solution to better characterize the plant endocytic machinery and the dynamics of one's favorite cargo protein.
2	4	37	Psychology  	 Prosocial behavior  	 Fairness; Justice; Empathy; Self-awareness        	Although managing fairness is a critical concern for organizations, not all managers are predisposed to enact high levels of fairness. Emerging empirical evidence suggests that personality characteristics can be an important antecedent of managers' fair behavior. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to understand how to promote fairness among managers who are naturally predisposed to engage in lower levels of fairness. Building upon self-awareness theory, we argue that increasing managers' self-awareness can motivate managers with low trait empathy to engage in greater levels of justice. We test the interactive effects of trait empathy and state self-awareness using an experimental study (N = 76) in which individuals were asked to communicate negative news. In support of our hypothesis, our results indicate that increasing self-awareness through self-focusing situations can help promote interactional justice when communicating negative news for individuals with low trait empathy. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.
2	3	36	Psychology  	 Nonverbal communication  	 infants; cognition; metacognition; performance monitoring; uncertainty        	Uncertainty monitoring is a core property of metacognition, allowing individuals to adapt their decision-making strategies depending on the state of their knowledge. Although it has been argued that other animals share these metacognitive abilities, only humans seem to possess the ability to explicitly communicate their own uncertainty to others. It remains unknown whether this capacity is present early in development, or whether it emerges later with the ability to verbally report one's own mental states. Here, using a nonverbal memory-monitoring paradigm, we show that 20-month-olds can monitor and report their own uncertainty. Infants had to remember the location of a hidden toy before pointing to indicate where they wanted to recover it. In an experimental group, infants were given the possibility to ask for help through nonverbal communication when they had forgotten the toy location. Compared with a control group in which infants had no other option but to decide by themselves, infants given the opportunity to ask for help used this option strategically to improve their performance. Asking for help was used selectively to avoid making errors and to decline difficult choices. These results demonstrate that infants are able to successfully monitor their own uncertainty and share this information with others to fulfill their goals.

The main idea was to utilize the Hadoop processing framework and its storage and computational capabilities in analytical tasks designed and implemented in R language. For such purposes, we decided to use the Hadoop HDFS and MapReduce v2 for storage and handling of the processing logic connected via Tessera framework to analytical functions written in R. The results of the analysis were presented as the graph visualizations. Visualizations were implemented using the Trelliscope framework for flexible visualizations of large complex data in R environment in fast and effective fashion.

In recent years, some research suggested that the presence of metal cations is an important regulator in the processes of misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta), which may be an important etiological factor of Alzheimer's disease. However, the knowledge on the principle of interactions between A beta and metal cations at the single molecule level is still poor understood. In this paper, the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) was fabricated on substrate of mixed thiol-modified gold nanoparticles using self-assembled monolayer method and the adhesion force in the longitudinal direction between metal cations and A beta 42 were investigated by AFM. The role of metal ions on A beta aggregation is discussed from the perspective of single molecular force. The force results showed that the specific adhesion force F-i and the nonspecific force F-0 between a single A beta-A beta pair in control experiment were calculated as 42 +/- 3 and 80 pN, respectively. However, Fi between a single A beta-A beta pair in the presence of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+ and Al3+ increased dramatically to 84 +/- 6, 89 +/- 3, 73 +/- 5, 95 +/- 5 pN successively, which indicated that unbinding between A beta proteins is accelerated in the presence of metal cations. What is more, the imaging results showed that substoichiometric copper cations accelerate the formation of fibrils within 3 days. The combined atomic force spectroscopy and imaging analysis indicate that metal cations play a role in promoting the aggregating behavior of A beta 42.
0	6	6	CS 	 Image processing  	 medical image processing; tumor deformation; tumor motion; morphing; 4DCT; lung tumor        	During image-guided cancer radiation treatment, three-dimensional (3D) tumor volumetric information is important for treatment success. However, it is typically not feasible to image a patient's 3D tumor continuously in real time during treatment due to concern over excessive patient radiation dose. We present a new iterative morphing algorithm to predict the real-time 3D tumor volume based on time-resolved computed tomography (4DCT) acquired before treatment. An offline iterative learning process has been designed to derive a target volumetric deformation function from one breathing phase to another. Real-time volumetric prediction is performed to derive the target 3D volume during treatment delivery. The proposed iterative deformable approach for tumor volume morphing and prediction based on 4DCT is innovative because it makes three major contributions: (1) a novel approach to landmark selection on 3D tumor surfaces using a minimum bounding box; (2) an iterative morphing algorithm to generate the 3D tumor volume using mapped landmarks; and (3) an online tumor volume prediction strategy based on previously trained deformation functions utilizing 4DCT. The experimental performance showed that the maximum morphing deviations are 0.27% and 1.25% for original patient data and artificially generated data, which is promising. This newly developed algorithm and implementation will have important applications for treatment planning, dose calculation and treatment validation in cancer radiation treatment.
0	1	1	CS 	 Machine learning  	 Biomedical image processing; Kalman filtering; medical robotics; needle insertion; particle filtering; ultrasound (US) imaging        	Percutaneous image-guided tumor ablation is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of malignant tumors using a needle-shaped ablation probe. Automating the insertion of a needle by using a robot could increase the accuracy and decrease the execution time of the procedure. Extracting the needle tip position from the ultrasound (US) images is of paramount importance for verifying that the needle is not approaching any forbidden regions (e.g., major vessels and ribs), and could also be used as a direct feedback signal to the robot inserting the needle. A method for estimating the needle tip has previously been developed combining a modified Hough transform, image filters, and machine learning. This paper improves that method by introducing a dynamic selection of the region of interest in the US images and filtering the tracking results using either a Kalman filter or a particle filter. Experiments where a biopsy needle has been inserted into a phantom by a robot have been conducted, guided by an infrared tracking system. The proposed method has been accurately evaluated by comparing its estimations with the needle tip's positions manually detected by a physician in the US images. The results show a significant improvement in precision and more than 85% reduction of 95th percentile of the error compared with the previous automatic approaches. The method runs in real time with a frame rate of 35.4 frames/s. The increased robustness and accuracy can make our algorithm usable in autonomous surgical systems for needle insertion.
0	3	3	CS 	 Cryptography  	 Public-key encryption; Attribute-based encryption; Predicate encryption; Self-updatable encryption; Revocation; Key evolving systems; Cloud storage        	"Revocation and key evolving paradigms are central issues in cryptography, and in PKI in particular. A novel concern related to these areas was raised in the recent work of Sahai, Seyalioglu, and Waters (CRYPTO 2012) who noticed that revoking past keys should at times (e.g., the scenario of cloud storage) be accompanied by revocation of past ciphertexts (to prevent unread ciphertexts from being read by revoked users). They introduced revocable-storage attribute-based encryption (RS-ABE) as a good access control mechanism for cloud storage. RS-ABE protects against the revoked users not only the future data by supporting key-revocation but also the past data by supporting ciphertext-update, through which a ciphertext at time T can be updated to a new ciphertext at time T 1 using only the public key. Motivated by this pioneering work, we ask whether it is possible to have a modular approach, which includes a primitive for time managed ciphertext update as a primitive. We call encryption which supports this primitive a ""self-updatable encryption"" (SUE). We then suggest a modular cryptosystems design methodology based on three sub-components: a primary encryption scheme, a key-revocation mechanism, and a time-evolution mechanism which controls the ciphertext self-updating via an SUE method, coordinated with the revocation (when needed). Our goal in this is to allow the self-updating ciphertext component to take part in the design of new and improved cryptosystems and protocols in a flexible fashion. Specifically, we achieve the following results: We first introduce a new cryptographic primitive called self-updatable encryption (SUE), realizing a time-evolution mechanism. In SUE, a ciphertext and a private key are associated with time. A user can decrypt a ciphertext if its time is earlier than that of his private key. Additionally, anyone (e.g., a cloud server) can update the ciphertext to a ciphertext with a newer time. We also construct an SUE scheme and prove its full security under static assumptions. Following our modular approach, we present a new RS-ABE scheme with shorter ciphertexts than that of Sahai et al. and prove its security. The length efficiency is mainly due to our SUE scheme and the underlying modularity. We apply our approach to predicate encryption (PE) supporting attribute-hiding property, and obtain a revocable storage PE (RS-PE) scheme that is selectively-secure. We further demonstrate that SUE is of independent interest, by showing it can be used for timed-release encryption (and its applications), and for augmenting key-insulated encryption with forward-secure storage.

5	22	94	Medical 	 Healthy Sleep  	 Sleep habits; sleep routine; sleep time; time use; work-family responsibilities        	Healthy sleep habits include sufficient sleep, regular bedtimes and established sleep routines. The responsibilities of paid and unpaid work that arise during the daytime are assumed to haunt us at night as well, eventually affecting these sleep habits. A long-term comparison of sleep duration from 1966 and 1999 time-diary data shows that sleep duration has not declined to the large extent that is generally assumed. Moreover, analyses of timing of sleep and sleep routines using time-diary data from 1999 and 2004 also do not show much evidence of this assumed decline. On the contrary, increasing work and family responsibilities positively affect regular bedtimes and sleep routines.

Buyer-seller watermarking protocol is fundamentally applied to continue the digital rights of both buyers and seller. We proposed an identity-based buyer-seller watermarking protocol that encounters various weaknesses of Zhang et al.'s watermarking protocol. We ensured that by pointing out these weaknesses, inaccuracy can be minimised for further implementing the buyer-seller watermarking protocol. The suggested protocol uses ID-based public key cryptography and digital watermarking scheme to place the ownership of digital content. Hence, copyright protection is attained. We claim that our suggested protocol is efficient and has adequate security as compared to traditionally proposed protocols, and therefore suitable for any practical buyer-seller watermarking scheme.
5	3	75	Medical 	 Ankylosing Spondylitis  	 ankylosing spondylitis; intestinal; microbiota; microbiome; treatment        	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the sacroiliac joints and the spine, for which the pathogenesis is thought to be a result of the combination of host genetic factors and environmental triggers. However, the precise factors that determine one's susceptibility to AS remain to be unraveled. With 100 trillion bacteria residing in the mammalian gut having established a symbiotic relation with their host influencing many aspects of host metabolism, physiology, and immunity, a growing body of evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may play an important role in AS. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the potential role of the microbiome in the etiology of AS, such as alterations of intestinal permeability, stimulation of immune responses, and molecular mimicry. In this review, the existing evidence for the involvement of the microbiome in AS pathogenesis was discussed and the potential of intestinal microbiome-targeting strategies in the prevention and treatment of AS was evaluated.

Material and methods: We studied the mRNA and protein expression and the promoter methylation levels of TFPI-2 in the PE placentas compared with those in the normal pregnant (NP) women. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and Sequenom Mass ARRAY were used for placenta tissue detection. Results: The expressions of TFPI-2 mRNA and protein were significantly elevated in the PE placentas when compared with those in the NP ones (P<0.05). Hypomethylation of the TFPI-2 promoter was detected both in PE patients and NP women, with a significant decrease in PE placentas (P = 0.005). The methylation level was significantly decreased at CpG_6 (-168 to -167), CpG_15 (-98 to -97) and CpG_18.19 (-68 to -65) in PE patients than that in normal placentas (P0.05). Conclusion: Over-expression of TFPI-2 and aberrant promoter mythylation status presented in the PE placentas, suggesting that epigenetic mechanism might contribute to the pathogenesis of PE.

0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 distributed computing; linear matrix inequality; Large-scale multi-agent system; stabilisability        	Large-scale dynamic systems are becoming highly pervasive in their occurrence with applications ranging from system biology, environment monitoring, sensor networks, and power systems. They are characterised by high dimensionality, complexity, and uncertainty in the node dynamic/interactions that require more and more computational demanding methods for their analysis and control design, as well as the network size and node system/interaction complexity increase. Therefore, it is a challenging problem to find scalable computational method for distributed control design of large-scale networks. In this paper, we investigate the robust distributed stabilisation problem of large-scale nonlinear multi-agent systems (briefly MASs) composed of non-identical (heterogeneous) linear dynamical systems coupled by uncertain nonlinear time-varying interconnections. By employing Lyapunov stability theory and linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, new conditions are given for the distributed control design of large-scale MASs that can be easily solved by the toolbox of MATLAB. The stabilisability of each node dynamic is a sufficient assumption to design a global stabilising distributed control. The proposed approach improves some of the existing LMI-based results on MAS by both overcoming their computational limits and extending the applicative scenario to large-scale nonlinear heterogeneous MASs. Additionally, the proposed LMI conditions are further reduced in terms of computational requirement in the case of weakly heterogeneous MASs, which is a common scenario in real application where the network nodes and links are affected by parameter uncertainties. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is to allow to move from a centralised towards a distributed computing architecture so that the expensive computation workload spent to solve LMIs may be shared among processors located at the networked nodes, thus increasing the scalability of the approach than the network size. Finally, a numerical example shows the applicability of the proposed method and its advantage in terms of computational complexity when compared with the existing approaches.
5	20	92	Medical 	 Fungal Infection  	 Apoptosis; Caspases; Chytridiomycosis; TUNEL; Wildlife disease        	Background. Amphibians are declining at an alarming rate, and one of the major causes of decline is the infectious disease chytridiomycosis. Parasitic fungal sporangia occur within epidermal cells causing epidermal disruption, but these changes have not been well characterised. Apoptosis (planned cell death) can be a damaging response to the host but may alternatively be a mechanism of pathogen removal for some intracellular infections. Methods. In this study we experimentally infected two endangered amphibian species Pseudophryne corroboree and Litoria verreauxii alpina with the causal agent of chytridiomycosis. We quantified cell death in the epidermis through two assays: terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) and caspase 3/7. Results. Cell death was positively associated with infection load and morbidity of clinically infected animals. In infected amphibians, TUNEL positive cells were concentrated in epidermal layers, correlating to the localisation of infection within the skin. Caspase activity was stable and low in early infection, where pathogen loads were light but increasing. In animals that recovered from infection, caspase activity gradually returned to normal as the infection cleared. Whereas, in amphibians that did not recover, caspase activity increased dramatically when infection loads peaked. Discussion. Increased cell death may be a pathology of the fungal parasite, likely contributing to loss of skin homeostatic functions, but it is also possible that apoptosis suppression may be used initially by the pathogen to help establish infection. Further research should explore the specific mechanisms of cell death and more specifically apoptosis regulation during fungal infection.

Stress influence lines (SIL) or its derivatives are recognized as very promising indices for damage detection. Compared with bridge global responses (such as displacement and acceleration), stress/strain can be more conveniently measured and is often more sensitive to local damages. This paper explores a novel damage localization approach by synthesizing SIL measurements from multiple locations, in which Dempster-Shafer data fusion technique is utilized. Compared with the measurement from a single sensor, more reliable damage-related information with the improved sensitivity and capability in damage localization can be obtained by synthesizing the measured SILs from a number of sensors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a numerical case study of the Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge. Different hypothetical scenarios, including single-damage case, double-damage, and no-damage cases, are considered in the validation. The comparison with the damage detection results using single-sensor data clearly indicates that the data fusion technique effectively enhance the consistency in the information (e.g., damage-induced structural change) and minimize non-consistent information (e.g. ""noise"" effect) from multiple sensors installed close to damage. The increasing number of sensors benefits the damage detection results. Excellent damage detection accuracy can be achieved, if different types of bridge components are properly selected for the monitoring. Therefore, it is promising to use the proposed approach in this study in the damage localization of real-world long-span bridges. Parametric studies are conducted to examine the effects of parameter selections and noise levels in this approach."
1	0	17	ECE 	 Electricity  	 Time series representation; Symbolic representation; Stream processing; Lower bound        	Over the past years, many representations for time series were proposed with the main purpose of dimensionality reduction and as a support for various algorithms in the domain of time series data processing. However, most of the transformation algorithms are not directly applicable on streams of data but only on static collections of the data as they are iterative in their nature. In this work we propose a symbolic representation of time series along with a method for transformation of time series data into the proposed representation. As one of the basic requirements for applicable representation is the distance measure which would accurately reflect the true shape of the data, we propose a distance measure operating on the proposed representation and lower bounding the Euclidean distance on the original data. We evaluate properties of the proposed representation and the distance measure on the UCR collection of datasets. As we focus on stream data processing, we evaluate the properties and limitations of the proposed representation on very long time series from the domain of electricity consumption monitoring, simulating the processing of potentially unbound data stream.

6	4	129	biochemistry 	 Genetics  	 human fetus; calcium-binding protein; cell motility; restorative strategy; olfactory system        	The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is viewed as a glia-enriched conduit of forward-migrating neuroblasts in which chemorepulsive signals control the pace of forward migration. Here we demonstrate the existence of a scaffold of neurons that receive synaptic inputs within the rat, mouse, and human fetal RMS equivalents. These neurons express secretagogin, a Ca2+-sensor protein, to execute an annexin V-dependent externalization of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) for reconfiguring the extracellular matrix locally. Mouse genetics combined with pharmacological probing in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that MMP-2 externalization occurs on demand and that its loss slows neuroblast migration. Loss of function is particularly remarkable upon injury to the olfactory bulb. Cumulatively, we identify a signaling cascade that provokes structural remodeling of the RMS through recruitment of MMP-2 by a previously unrecognized neuronal constituent. Given the life-long presence of secretagogin-containing neurons in human, this mechanism might be exploited for therapeutic benefit in rescue strategies.

Bipolar EGMs are often used but possess polarity and shape dependence on catheter orientation contributing to uncertainty. Objective: We describe a novel method to map cardiac activation that resolves signals into meaningful directions and is insensitive to electrode directional effects. Methods: Multielectrode catheters that span 2-and 3-D space are used to derive local electric field (E-field) signals. A traveling wave model of local EGM propagation motivates a new ""omnipolar"" reference frame in which to understand EGM E-field signals and provide bipolar component EGMs aligned with these anatomic and physiologic directions. We validate the basis of this technology and determine its accuracy using a saline tank in which we simulate physiologic propagation. Results: Omnipole signals from healthy tissue are nearly free of catheter orientation effects and are constrained by biophysics to consistent morphologies and thus consistent measured amplitudes and timings. Using a 3-D EP mapping system, traveling wave treatment, and omnipolar technology (OT) E-field loops, we derived a new and nearly instantaneous means to determine conduction velocity and activation direction. Conclusion: We describe the basis of OT and validate it with ablation and mapping catheters in a saline tank. Finally, we illustrate OT with signals from live subjects. Significance: OT's novel approach with signal processing and real-time visualization allows for a newly detailed characterization of myocardial activation that is insensitive to catheter orientation."

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/Morbus Bechterew is a chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disease. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction is involved in 4-35% of AS cases, and is correlated to the severity and extension of AS. Even though AS-caused TMJ ankylosis is exceptional, one should have high index of suspicion of TMJ ankylosis in AS for an early detection, because it is an extremely serious and disabling condition that causes problems with mastication, swallowing, digestion, speech, appearance and poor oral hygiene with heavy caries. Case report. A 54-year-old male patient sought medical attention at the Department of Periodontology and Oral Medicine, Clinic for Dentistry at the Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia, with the chief complaint of pain in the area of the upper left canine in the presence of limited mouth opening. The treatment plan consisted of upper left canine management and rehabilitation of the remaining teeth in the frontal and the premolar region in both, the upper and lower jaw. Even though molar region needed to be treated, unfortunately it was not in the treatment plan because ankylosis of TMJ made the treatment impossible. Conclusion. The patients with AS-caused TMJ ankylosis are considered a diagnostic challenge to routine dentistry. Accent should be given to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary approach in the treatment of the AS patients towards the favorable disease course and outcome.
0	10	10	CS 	 Distributed computing  	 Distributed clouds; Cloud computing; Data analytics; CometCloud        	We introduce an architecture for undertaking data processing across multiple layers of a distributed computing infrastructure, composed of edge devices (making use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) based protocols), intermediate gateway nodes and large scale data centres. In this way, data processing that is intended to be carried out in the data centre can be pushed to the edges of the network - enabling more efficient use of data centre and in-network resources. We suggest the need for specialist data analysis and management algorithms that are resource-aware, and are able to split computation across these different layers. We propose a coordination mechanism that is able to combine different types of data processing capability, such as in-transit and in-situ. An application scenario is used to illustrate the concepts, subsequently evaluated through a multi-site deployment.

6	2	127	biochemistry 	 Human Metabolism  	 DNA fingerprinting; gut microbiota; human flora associated animal model; piglet        	Direct research on gut microbiota for understanding its role as 'an important organ' in human individuals is difficult owing to its vast diversity and host specificity as well as ethical concerns. Transplantation of human gut microbiota into surrogate hosts can significantly facilitate the research of human gut ecology, metabolism and immunity but rodents-based model provides results with low relevance to humans. A new human flora-associated ( HFA) piglet model was hereby established taking advantage of the high similarity between pigs and humans with respect to the anatomy, physiology and metabolism of the digestive system. Piglets were delivered via cesarean section into a SPF-level barrier system and were inoculated orally with a whole fecal suspension from one healthy 10-year-old boy. The establishment and composition of the intestinal microbiota of the HFA piglets were analyzed and compared with that of the human donor using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence-PCR fingerprinting-based community DNA hybridization, group-specific PCR-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR. Molecular profiling demonstrated that transplantation of gut microbiota from a human to germfree piglets produced a donor-like microbial community with minimal individual variation. And the microbial succession with aging of those ex-germfree piglets was also similar to that observed in humans. This HFA model provides a significantly improved system for research on gut ecology in human metabolism, nutrition and drug discovery.
5	3	75	Medical 	 Ankylosing Spondylitis  	 coxarthrosis; inflammation; mean platelet volume; platelet lymphocyte ratio; risk factors        	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low grade systemic inflammatory disease in which many inflammatory mediators are known to be elevated in the peripheric blood. Blood platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) are accepted as novel markers in many of the systemic inflammatory disorders, but have not been investigated in synovitis-free radiographic OA yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of blood PLR and MPV in radiographic hip OA. A total of 880 patients were evaluated retrospectively and after certain exclusion criteria, 237 of them who have primary hip OA were included. Age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), PLR, and MPV levels were recorded, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading of the hip joints were performed. Patients were then divided into 2 groups as KL grades 1 to 2 (mild-moderate) and KL grades 3 to 4 (severe) hip OA. Mean age, mean neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet counts, mean MPV, mean PLR, and mean ESR were statistically significantly different between mild/moderate hip OA group and severe hip OA group. In univariate analysis, older age and higher MPV, PLR, and ESR were severely associated with severe hip OA. In multiple logistic regression analysis, MPV, PLR, and ESR emerged as independent predictors of severe hip OA. The results of the present study, for the first time in the literature, suggest blood PLR and MPV as novel inflammatory markers predicting the radiographic severity of hip OA in the daily practice.
5	29	101	Medical 	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome  	 Functional Bowel Disorder; Bacteria; Microbiome        	BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have limited knowledge about the association between the composition of the intestinal microbiota and clinical features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We collected information on the fecal and mucosa-associated microbiota of patients with IBS and evaluated whether these were associated with symptoms. METHODS: We collected fecal and mucosal samples from adult patients who met the Rome III criteria for IBS at a secondary/tertiary care outpatient clinics in Sweden, as well as from healthy subjects. The exploratory set comprised 149 subjects (110 with IBS and 39 healthy subjects); 232 fecal samples and 59 mucosal biopsy samples were collected and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA targeted pyrosequencing. The validation set comprised 46 subjects (29 with IBS and 17 healthy subjects); 46 fecal samples, but no mucosal samples, were collected and analyzed. For each subject, we measured exhaled H-2 and CH4, oro-anal transit time, and the severity of psychological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal methanogens were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Numerical ecology analyses and a machine learning procedure were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Fecal microbiota showed covariation with mucosal adherent microbiota. By using classic approaches, we found no differences in fecal microbiota abundance or composition between patients with IBS vs healthy patients. A machine learning procedure, a computational statistical technique, allowed us to reduce the 16S ribosomal RNA data complexity into a microbial signature for severe IBS, consisting of 90 bacterial operational taxonomic units. We confirmed the robustness of the intestinal microbial signature for severe IBS in the validation set. The signature was able to discriminate between patients with severe symptoms, patients with mild/moderate symptoms, and healthy subjects. By using this intestinal microbiota signature, we found IBS symptom severity to be associated negatively with microbial richness, exhaled CH4, presence of methanogens, and enterotypes enriched with Clostridiales or Prevotella species. This microbiota signature could not be explained by differences in diet or use of medications. CONCLUSIONS: In analyzing fecal and mucosal microbiota from patients with IBS and healthy individuals, we identified an intestinal microbiota profile that is associated with the severity of IBS symptoms.

The FPAADD is a hybrid combination of a field programmable analog array (FPAA) and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Unlike other FPMAs where the FPGA and FPAA portions are kept separate, this architecture closely integrates the two in a fine-grained interleaved array. Instead of using hard-coded data converters, the FPAADD synthesizes data converters out of its reconfigurable fabric. The analog and digital portions share a common global interconnect. Floating gate (FG) transistors are used as the switch and memory elements of the chip, providing better switch performance and power over traditional static random-access memory-based approaches. The precise programmability of the FG switches also allows for computation to take place in the interconnect. These key differences make the FPAADD much more general purpose than previous FPMA architectures. The FPAADD consists of 27 x 8 array of 108 digital and 108 analog tiles and peripheral circuitry on 5 x 5 mm(2) die fabricated in a 0.35-mu m CMOS process, and contains more than 130 000 FG transistors.

The abortifacient and anti-implantation activities of the extract were investigated, in-vivo and estimated the level of different hormones release. Results: The result revealed the effectiveness of methanol (87%) and aqueous (68%) extract of the plant on uterotonic activity. The extracts showed relatively non-toxic effect in acute toxicity study. Methanolic extract has shown higher efficacy for both abortifacient (**p<0.01) and anti-implantation performance (**p< 0.01) and also effected hormone release level (**p< 0.01). Conclusion: Methanolic extract of Diynaria quercifolia (L) J. Smith rhizome has been proved to have significant anti-fertility activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 diagnosis; IgE; IgE-associated allergic diseases; prevention; therapy        	IgE-associated allergic diseases belong to the most common inflammatory conditions. Their clinical manifestation ranges from mild symptoms to life-threatening episodes. Often patients experience a reduction in physical and psychologic well-being and suffer from a decreased quality of life due to disease activity. The continuously rising number of people that are affected by an allergic condition indicates an urgent need for better diagnostics and more efficient treatment options. Recent progress in the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying IgE-associated allergic disorders has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of drug candidates that are currently under evaluation. In this review, we highlight studies and clinical trials, which have helped to gain further insight in the etiology of IgE-associated allergic conditions as well as advances in the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches recently published in Allergy (European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology).
5	15	87	Medical 	 Diabetes  	 Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; (FRET); Quantum dots; Silicone hydrogel; Tear glucose; Non-invasive biosensor        	In this paper, a nanostructured biosensor is developed to detect glucose in tear by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching mechanism. The designed FRET pair, including the donor, CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), and the acceptor, dextran-binding malachite green (MG-dextran), was conjugated to concanavalin A (Con A), an enzyme with specific affinity to glucose. In the presence of glucose, the quenched emission of QDs through the FRET mechanism is restored by displacing the dextran from Con A. To have a dual-modulation sensor for convenient and accurate detection, the nanostructured FRET sensors were assembled onto a patterned ZnO nanorod array deposited on the synthetic silicone hydrogel. Consequently, the concentration of glucose detected by the patterned sensor can be converted to fluorescence spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio and calibrated image pixel value. The photoluminescence intensity of the patterned FRET sensor increases linearly with increasing concentration of glucose from 0.03 mmol/L to 3 mmol/L, which covers the range of tear glucose levels for both diabetics and healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the calibrated values of pixel intensities of the fluorescence images captured by a handhold fluorescence microscope increases with increasing glucose. Four male Sprague-Dawley rats with different blood glucose concentrations were utilized to demonstrate the quick response of the patterned FRET sensor to 2 mu L of tear samples.
3	5	57	MAE 	 Internal combustion engine  	 Well-to-wheel; Greenhouse gas emission; Electric vehicle; Electricity generation mix        	In the transport sector, electric vehicles (EVs) are widely accepted as the next technology paradigm, capable of solving the environmental problems associated with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). However, EVs also have environmental impacts that are directly related to the country's electricity generation mix. In countries without an environmentally friendly electricity generation mix, EVs may not be effective in lowering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we analyzed the extent to which the GHG emissions associated with EVs differs among 70 countries in the world, in relation to their domestic electricity generation mix. Then, we compared the results with the GHG emissions from the ICEVs. Countries with a high percentage of fossil fuels in their electricity generation mix showed high GHG emissions for EVs, and for some of these countries, EVs were associated with more GHG emissions than ICEVs. For these countries, policies based on the positive environmental impact of EVs may have to be reconsidered. In addition, different policies may need to be considered for different vehicle types (compact car, SUV, etc.), because the ability of EVs to reduce GHG emissions compared to that of ICEVs varies by vehicle type.

1	10	26	ECE 	 Single-phase electric power  	 Active Power Control; Power Factor Correction; Single-Phase Control Strategy; Power Quality; Synchronous Reference Frame Control Strategy        	In this paper is presented a synchronous reference frame control strategy applied to a single-phase microgrid system connected to a renewable energy power source. The control strategy aims to regulate active power flow and to optimize the power factor at the point of common coupling (PCC). The whole control system is carried out on the synchronous reference frame of the PCC voltage. On this frame the direct current is responsible for active power regulation while the quadrature one regulates power factor. The direct current is used to regulate the dc-link voltage of the single-phase converter, consequently keeping the active power balance on the system. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the system feasibility and effectiveness.
5	45	117	Medical 	 Psoriasis  	 Centella asiatica; Copal resin; Coronatine; Manila elemi resin; Plant cell cultures        	Centella asiatica is a herbaceous plant of Asian traditional medicine. Besides wound healing, this plant is recommended for the treatment or care of various skin conditions such as dry skin, leprosy, varicose ulcers, eczema, and/or psoriasis. Triterpene saponins, known as centellosides, are the main metabolites associated with these beneficial effects. Considering the interest in these high value active compounds, there is a need to develop biosustainable and economically viable processes to produce them. Previous work using C. asiatica plant cell culture technology demonstrated the efficient conversion of amyrin derivatives into centellosides, opening a new way to access these biomolecules. The current study was aimed at increasing the production of centellosides in C. asiatica plant cell cultures. Herein, we report the application of a new elicitor, coronatine, combined with the addition of amyrin-enriched resins as potential sustainable precursors in the centelloside pathway, for a positive synergistic effect on centelloside production. Our results show that coronatine is a powerful elicitor for increasing centelloside production and that treatments with sustainable natural sources of amyrins enhance centelloside yields. This process can be scaled up to an orbitally shaken CellBag, thereby increasing the capacity of the system for producing biomass and centellosides.
4	5	66	Civil 	 Suspension Bridge  	 GPS; RTS; data fusion; Gorgopotamos bridge; Greece; Structural Health Monitoring; dynamic multipath; noise; displacement; excitation; train        	Measurement of deflections of certain bridges is usually hampered by corruption of the GPS signal by multipath associated with passing vehicles, resulting to unrealistically large apparent displacements. Field data from the Gorgopotamos train bridge in Greece and systematic experiments revealed that such bias is due to superimposition of two major effects, (i) changes in the geometry of satellites because of partial masking of certain satellites by the passing vehicles (this effect can be faced with solutions excluding satellites that get temporarily blocked by passing vehicles) and (ii) dynamic multipath caused from reflection of satellite signals on the passing trains, a high frequency multipath effect, different from the static multipath. Dynamic multipath seems to have rather irregular amplitude, depending on the geometry of measured satellites, but a typical pattern, mainly consisting of a baseline offset, wide base peaks correlating with the sequence of main reflective surfaces of the vehicles passing next to the antenna. In cases of limited corruption of GPS signal by dynamic multipath, corresponding to scale distortion of the short-period component of the GPS waveforms, we propose an algorithm which permits to reconstruct the waveform of bridge deflections using a weak fusion of GPS and RTS data, based on the complementary characteristics of the two instruments. By application of the proposed algorithm we managed to extract semi-static and dynamic displacements and oscillation frequencies of a historical railway bridge under train loading by using noisy GPS and RTS recordings. The combination of GPS and RTS is possible because these two sensors can be fully collocated and have complementary characteristics, with RTS and GPS focusing on the long- and short-period characteristics of the displacement, respectively.
0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Image matching; mismatch removal; shape interaction matrix; affine invariance; image retrieval        	Mismatch removal is a key step in many computer vision problems. In this paper, we handle the mismatch removal problem by adopting shape interaction matrix (SIM). Given the homogeneous coordinates of the two corresponding point sets, we first compute the SIMs of the two point sets. Then, we detect the mismatches by picking out the most different entries between the two SIMs. Even under strong affine transformations, outliers, noises, and burstiness, our method can still work well. Actually, this paper is the first non-iterative mismatch removal method that achieves affine invariance. Extensive results on synthetic 2D points matching data sets and real image matching data sets verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our method in removing mismatches. Moreover, when applied to partial-duplicate image search, our method reaches higher retrieval precisions with shorter time cost compared with the state-of-the-art geometric verification methods.
1	5	22	ECE 	 System identification  	 FRF; Decomposition; Modal analysis; Mode shape; Machine tools        	The paper deals with the automatic decomposition of experimental frequency response functions (FRF's) of mechanical structures. The decomposition of FRF's is based on the Green function representation of free vibratory systems. After the determination of the impulse dynamic subspace, the system matrix is formulated and the poles are calculated directly. By means of the corresponding eigenvectors, the contribution of each element of the impulse dynamic subspace is determined and the sufficient decomposition of the corresponding FRF is carried out. With the presented dominant modal decomposition (DMD) method, the mode shapes, the modal participation vectors and the modal scaling factors are identified using the decomposed FRF's. Analytical example is presented along with experimental case studies taken from machine tool industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
5	7	40	Medical 	 Depression  	 Brain ischemia; electrophysiology; brain trauma; subarachnoid hemorrhage; acute stroke; neurocritical care; spreading depression        	Spreading depolarizations cause cortical electrical potential changes over a wide spectral range that includes slow potentials approaching the direct current (or 0 Hz) level. The negative direct current shift (<0.05 Hz) is an important identifier of cortical depolarization and its duration is a measure of potential tissue injury associated with longer lasting depolarizations. To determine the feasibility of monitoring the full signal bandwidth of spreading depolarizations in patients, we performed subdural electrocorticography using platinum electrode strips and direct current-coupled amplifiers in 27 patients with acute brain injury at two neurosurgical centers. While large baseline direct current offsets developed, loss of data due to amplifier saturation was minimal and rates of baseline drift throughout recordings were generally low. Transient negative direct current shifts of spreading depolarizations were easily recognized and in 306/551 (56%) cases had stereotyped, measurable characteristics. Following a standardized training session, novice scorers achieved a high degree of accuracy and interobserver reliability in identifying depolarizations, suggesting that direct current-coupled recordings can facilitate bedside diagnosis for future trials or clinical decision-making. We conclude that intracranial monitoring of slow potentials can be achieved with platinum electrodes and that unfiltered, direct current-coupled recordings are advantageous for identifying and assessing the impact of spreading depolarizations.
3	7	59	MAE 	 Materials Engineering  	 Microscopy; Training; Nanotechnology; Workforce Development        	Preparing an effective workforce in high technology is the goal of both academic and industry training, and has been the engine that drives innovation and product development in the United States for over a century. During the last 50 years, technician training has comprised a combination of two-year academic programs, internships and apprentice training, and extensive On-the-Job Training (OJT). Recently, and especially in Silicon Valley, technicians have four-year college degrees, as well as relevant hands-on training. Characterization in general, and microscopy in particular, is an essential tool in process development, manufacturing and QA/QC, and failure analysis. Training for a broad range of skills and practice is challenging, especially for community colleges. Workforce studies (SRI/Boeing) suggest that even four year colleges often do not provide the relevant training and experience in laboratory skills, especially design of experiments and analysis of data. Companies in high-tech further report difficulty in finding skilled labor, especially with industry specific experience. Foothill College, in partnership with UCSC, SJSU, and NASA-Ames, has developed a microscopy training program embedded in a research laboratory, itself a partnership between university and government, providing hands-on experience in advanced instrumentation, experimental design and problem solving, with real-world context from small business innovators, in an environment called 'the collaboratory'. The program builds on AFM-SEM training at Foothill, and provides affordable training in FE-SEM and TEM through a cost recovery model. In addition to instrument and engineering training, the collaboratory also supports academic and personal growth through a multiplayer social network of students, faculty, researchers, and innovators.

To achieve this purpose, a 16-channel ASIC chip, PARISROC 2 (Photomultiplier ARray Integrated in SiGe ReaclOut Chip) is used in the analog signal processing and digitization. The digitized results are sent to the server by a user-defined User Datagram Protocol/Internet Protocol (UDP/IP) hardcore engine through Ethernet that is managed by a FPGA. A prototype electronics fulfilling the requirements of the Wide Field of View Cherenkov Telescope Array (WFCTA) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) project has been designed, fabricated and tested to prove the concept of the design. A detailed description of the development with the results of the test measurements are presented. By using a new input structure and a new configuration of the ASIC, the dynamic range of the circuit is extended. A highly precise time calibrating algorithm is also proposed, verified and optimized for the mass production. The test results suggest that the proposed electronics design fulfills the general specification of the future IACTs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this design, a differential output differential amplifier merged with a single output differential amplifier is used so that positive feedback can be applied appropriately. The proposed Op-Amp is designed in 0.18 mu m CMOS process using gpdk45nm library in Cadence virtuoso analog design environment. The simulation of proposed circuit results in 116.2dB gain, 281MHz UGB, 72 degree phase margin and 620 mu W power consumption. The Monte Carlo analysis of the circuit indicates that the variation of power supply voltage produces minimal effect on the gain and phase of the circuit.
6	3	128	biochemistry 	 Immunology  	 Autoimmunity; Regulatory cells; Systemic autoimmune diseases; Tolerance induction; Transplant rejection        	In physiological circumstances, various tolerogenic mechanisms support the protection of self-structures during immune responses. However, quantitative and/or qualitative changes in regulatory immune cells and mediators can evoke auto-reactive immune responses, and upon susceptible genetic background, along with the presence of other concomitant etiological factors, autoimmune disease may develop. In transplant immunology, tolerogenic mechanisms are also critical, since the balance between of alloantigen-reactive effector cells and the regulatory immune cells will ultimately determine whether a graft is accepted or rejected. Better understanding of the immunological tolerance and the potential modulations of immune regulatory processes are crucial for developing effective therapies in autoimmune diseases as well as in organ transplantation. In this review, we focus on the novel insights regarding the impaired immune regulation and other relevant factors contributing to the development of auto-reactive and graft-reactive immune responses in autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection, respectively. We also address some promising approaches for modification of immune-regulatory processes and tolerogenic mechanisms in autoimmunity and solid organ transplantation, which may be beneficial in future therapeutic strategies.

2	15	48	Psychology  	 Gender roles  	 Television; fiction; woman; gender; feminism; work; analysis; socio-semiotics        	During the sixties and seventies the limited presence of women in the public sphere was reflected in the restricted repertoire of roles played by female characters in television fiction (mainly those of mothers and wives). The strengthening of the feminist movement in the following decades increased and diversified the portrayals of women in the workplace, and further encouraged academic research on the social construction of working women. Despite the relevance of female professionals in current TV shows, the importance of romantic relationships and sexuality has led to a decreasing number of studies on the subject. This article summarizes the results of a study on working women in Spanish TV fiction, part of a larger project on the construction of female identities. The research uses an original methodology that combines quantitative techniques and qualitative methods (socio-semiotics) to analyse the sample of 709 female characters. The results show a coexistence of the traditional stereotypes of working women in customer service and care-giving positions with those of highly skilled female professionals. However, the empowerment of women in positions of responsibility is often associated with a negative portrayal of the character, while the problems of reconciling family and work are systematically avoided.
4	7	68	Civil 	 Green Building  	 Green renovation; PM2.5; VOC; Black carbon; Formaldehyde        	Green eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n = 28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6 months and at 12 months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n = 14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682 ng/m(3) in post-renovation vs. 2364 ng/m(3) in pre-renovation home visits (p = 0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03 ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01 ppm) (p = 0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.

2	14	47	Psychology  	 Child abuse  	 child abuse; seizures; subdural hematoma; traumatic brain injury        	Objective: Traumatic brain injury causes substantial morbidity and mortality in children. Posttraumatic seizures may worsen outcomes after traumatic brain injury. Posttraumatic seizures risk factors are not completely understood. Our objective was to clarify posttraumatic seizures risk factors in a large cohort of children with severe traumatic brain injury. Design: Retrospective cohort study of a probabilistically linked dataset from the National Trauma Data Bank and the Pediatric Health Information Systems database, 2007-2010. Setting: Twenty-nine U.S. children's hospitals. Patients: A total of 2,122 children (age, < 18 yr old at admission) with linked National Trauma Data Bank and Pediatric Health Information Systems records, severe (emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, < 8) traumatic brain injury, hospital length of stay more than 24 hours, and nonmissing disposition. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The outcome was posttraumatic seizures, identified using validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. Prespecified candidate predictors of posttraumatic seizures included age, injury mechanism, emergency department Glasgow Coma Scale, intracranial hemorrhage type, hypoxia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. Posttraumatic seizures were diagnosed in 25.2% of children with severe traumatic brain injury. In those without abuse/assault or subdural hemorrhage, the posttraumatic seizures rate varied between 36.6% in those less than 2 years old and 16.4% in those 14-17 years old. Age, abusive mechanism, and subdural hemorrhage are each significant predictors of posttraumatic seizures. The risk of posttraumatic seizures has a complex relationship with these predictors. The estimated odds of posttraumatic seizures decrease with advancing age, odds ratio equal to 0.929 (0.905-0.954) per additional year of age with no abuse/assault and no subdural hemorrhage; odds ratio equal to 0.820 (0.730-0.922) per additional year of age when abuse and subdural hemorrhage are present. An infant with accidental traumatic brain injury and subdural hemorrhage has approximately the same estimated probability of posttraumatic seizures as an abused infant without subdural hemorrhage (47% [95% CI, 39-55%] vs 50% [95% CI, 41-58%]; p = 0.69). The triad of young age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage confers the greatest estimated probability for posttraumatic seizures (60% [95% CI, 53-66%]). Conclusions: Posttraumatic seizures risk in children with severe traumatic brain injury is greatest with a triad of younger age, injury by abuse/assault, and subdural hemorrhage. However, posttraumatic seizures are common even in the absence of these factors.
4	8	69	Civil 	 Solar Energy  	 Smart thermal grid; Solar district heating system; Distributed thermal storage; Seasonal thermal storage        	Smart thermal grids (STGs) are able to perform the same function as classical grids, but are developed in order to make better use of distributed, possibly intermittent, thermal energy resources and to provide the required energy when needed through efficient resources utilization and intelligent management. District heating (DH) plays a significant role in the implementation of future smart energy systems. To fulfil its role, DH technologies must be further developed to integrate renewable resources, create low temperature networks, and consequently to make existing or new DH networks ready for integration into future STGs. Solar heating is a promising option for low-temperature DH systems. Thermal energy storage (TES) can make the availability of the energy supply match the demand. An integration of centralized seasonal and distributed short-term thermal storages would facilitate an efficient recovery of the solar energy. This study, through modelling and simulation, investigates the impacts of such integration on the overall performance of a community-level solar DH system. The performance analysis results show that the solar DH system with integration of distributed and centralized seasonal TESs improves system overall efficiency, and reduces DH network heat losses, primary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, in comparison to the one without integration.

0	0	0	CS 	 Computer vision  	 Feature descriptor; Local derivative binary pattern; Object recognition        	Designing efficient and effective keypoint descriptors for an image plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks. The traditional binary descriptors such as local binary pattern and its variants directly perform a binarization operation on the intensity differences of the local affine covariant regions, thus their performance usually drops a lot because of the limited distinctiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel image keypoint descriptor, namely local derivative quantized binary pattern for object recognition. To incorporate the spatial information, we first divide the local affine covariant region into several subregions according to the intensity orders. For each sub region, we quantize the intensity differences between the central pixels and their neighbors in an adaptive way, and then we order the differences and use a hash function to map the differences into binary codes. The binary codes are histogramed to form the feature of each subregion. Furthermore, we utilize multi-scale support regions and pool the histograms together to represent the features of the image. Our approach does not need prior codebook training and hence it is more flexible and easy to be implemented. Moreover, our descriptor can preserve more local brightness and edge information than the traditional binary descriptors. Also, our descriptor is robust to rotation, illumination variations and other geometric transformations. Finally we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (i.e., 53 Objects, ZuBuD, and Kentucky) for object recognition and the experimental results show that our descriptor outperforms the existing state-of-the-art descriptors.
6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Connective tissue diseases; Lung diseases    interstitial; Lung diseases    interstitial      	Interstitial lung diseases ( ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of lung disorders with distinct clinical, radiological and morphological features. Among ILDs, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF) is associated with the worst prognosis, with a survival worse than many cancers, even after the advent of two anti- fibrotic drugs, shown to halve disease progression. Reaching the correct diagnosis is crucial, as pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment options differ substantially from other interstitial fibrosing processes where immune overactivity plays a role in driving fibrosis. However, a subgroup of patients with fibrotic lung disease mediated by immune dysregulation can experience relentlessly progressive fibrosis despite immunosuppressive treatment, and behave similarly to IPF. It is clear that even in non IPF ILDs, phenotypes of relentlessly progressive disease exist, and molecular pathways may overlap. One of the main challenges for the future is the use of high throughput molecular biology techniques to stratify patients with progressive fibrotic lung disease, in order to identify genetic, epigenetic and protein markers to predict the individual patient's rate of progression and fundamental molecular pathways involved. In this review, we will focus on the challenges in the diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as well as differences and areas of overlap with other fibrotic ILDs, including fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease- associated ILD and interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features.
5	5	77	Medical 	 Asthma  	 Interleukin-32 (IL-32); Spliced isoforms; Cytokine; Inflammatory disease; Cancer; Therapeutic approaches        	Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a novel cytokine involved in inflammation and cancer development. IL-32 gene consists of eight small exons, and IL-32 mRNA has nine alternative spliced isoforms, and was thought to be secreted because it contains an internal signal sequence and lacks a transmembrane region. IL-32 is initially expressed selectively in activated T cells by mitogen and activated NK cells and their expression is strongly augmented by microbes, mitogens, and other cytokines. The IL-32 is induced mainly by pathogens and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but IL-32 is more prominent in immune cells than in non-immune tissues. The IL-32 transcript is expressed in various human tissues and organs such as the spleen, thymus, leukocyte, lung, small intestine, colon, prostate, heart, placenta, liver, muscle, kidney, pancreas, and brain. Cytokines are critical components of cell signaling pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth, metabolism, hormone signaling, immune regulation and a variety of other physiological functions. Earlier studies have demonstrated that IL-32 regulates cell growth, metabolism and immune regulation and is therefore involved in the pathologic regulator or protectant of inflammatory diseases. Previous studies defined that IL-32 is upregulated in the patients with several inflammatory diseases, and is induced by inflammatory responses. However, several reports suggested that IL-32 is downregulated in several inflammatory diseases including asthma, HIV infection disease, neuronal diseases, metabolic disorders, experimental colitis and metabolic disorders. IL-32 is also involved in various cancer malignancies including renal cancer, esophageal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, colon cancer and thyroid carcinoma. Other studies suggested that IL-32 decreases tumor development including cervical cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. Nevertheless, review articles that discuss the roles and its mechanism of IL-32 isoforms focusing on the therapeutic approaches have not yet been reported. In this review article, we will discuss recent findings regarding IL-32 in the development of diseases and further discuss therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32. Moreover, we will suggest that IL-32 could be the target of several diseases and the therapeutic agents for targeting IL-32 may have potential beneficial effects for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers. Future research should open new avenues for the design of novel therapeutic approaches targeting IL-32. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twenty-four successive patients and 38 healthy volunteers, younger than 60 years of age, who were followed up for at least for one year in the outpatient clinics of physical therapy and rehabilitation with the diagnosis of PsA according to CASPAR criteria (17) and who did not complain of any hearing impairment were included in the study. Distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) values between 1 kHz and 4 kHz, tympanometric examination results, stapes reflex values, speech reception threshold (SRT) and speech discrimination (SD) values, pure-tone values between 250 and 8000 Hz and high-frequency values between 10,000, 12,500 and 16,000 Hz were analyzed. Statistical comparisons between both groups were performed using chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U test. p < 0.05 was accepted as the level of statistical significance. Results: Our study population consisted of 24 [9 male (37.5%) and 15 female (62.5%)] patients with a mean age of 47.21 +/- 11.28 (range, 28-59) years and 38 [16 male (42.1%) and 22 female (57.9%)] healthy volunteers with a mean age of 44.39 +/- 8.12 (range, 29-59) years as the control group. Mean duration of arthritis was 7.62 +/- 4.88 years. In the evaluation of hearing frequencies of the patients between 4000 and 6000 Hz, a statistically significant difference was found relative to the control group (p < 005). DPOAE values of the patients were analyzed within the 1000-4000 Hz interval. When compared with the control group, a statistically significant difference was found at 3000 and 4000 Hz (p < 005). Conclusion: Our study provides strong evidence suggesting the necessity of monitorization of these patients regarding sensorineural hearing loss so as to take measures against the development of hearing loss during early stage, which may be another disability in patients with PsA, which is itself a potential cause of severe disability.

5	43	115	Medical 	 Parkinson's Disease  	 SH-SY5Y cells; Retinoic acid; Parkinson's disease; Experimental model; 6-hydroxydopamine; Dopamine transporter        	Research on Parkinson's disease (PD) and drug development is hampered by the lack of suitable human in vitro models that simply and accurately recreate the disease conditions. To counteract this, many attempts to differentiate cell lines, such as the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma, into dopaminergic neurons have been undertaken since they are easier to cultivate when compared with other cellular models. Here, we characterized neuronal features discriminating undifferentiated and retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated SH-SYSY cells and described significant differences between these cell models in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) cytotoxicity. In contrast to undifferentiated cells, RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated low proliferative rate and a pronounced neuronal morphology with high expression of genes related to synapse vesicle cycle, dopamine synthesis/degradation, and of dopamine transporter (DAT). Significant differences between undifferentiated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells in the overall capacity of antioxidant defenses were found; although RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells presented a higher basal antioxidant capacity with high resistance against H2O2 insult, they were twofold more sensitive to 6-OHDA. DAT inhibition by 3 alpha-bis-4-fluorophenyl-methoxytropane and dithiothreitol (a cell-permeable thiol-reducing agent) protected RA-differentiated, but not undifferentiated, SH-SY5Y cells from oxidative damage and cell death caused by 6-OHDA. Here, we demonstrate that undifferentiated and RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells are two unique phenotypes and also have dissimilar mechanisms in 6-OHDA cytotoxicity. Hence, our data support the use of RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells as an in vitro model of PD. This study may impact our understanding of the pathological mechanisms of PD and the development of new therapies and drugs for the management of the disease.
5	13	85	Medical 	 Crohn's Disease  	 Irritable Bowel Syndrome; QOL; CD; UC; Prevalence        	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is unclear whether this relates to occult IBD activity. We attempted to resolve this issue in a secondary care population by using a cross-sectional study design. METHODS: We analyzed Rome III IBS symptoms, disease activity indices, and psychological, somatization, and quality of life data from 378 consecutive, unselected adult patients with IBD seen in clinics at St James's University Hospital in Leeds, United Kingdom from November 2012 through June 2015. Participants provided a stool sample for fecal calprotectin (FC) analysis; levels >= 250 mu g/g were used to define mucosal inflammation. By using symptom data and FC levels we identified 4 distinct groups of patients: those with true IBS-type symptoms (IBS-type symptoms with FC levels= 250 mg/g, regardless of IBS symptom status). We compared characteristics between these groups. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 206 patients with Crohn's disease (27.7%) and 34 of 172 patients with ulcerative colitis (19.8%) had true IBS-type symptoms. Levels of psychological comorbidity and somatization were significantly higher among patients with true IBS-type symptoms than patients with quiescent IBD or occult inflammation. Quality of life levels were also significantly reduced compared with patients with quiescent disease or occult inflammation and were similar to those of patients with active IBD. By using FC levels >= 100 mu g/g to define mucosal inflammation, we found a similar effect of IBS-type symptoms on psychological health and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-sectional study, we identified a distinct group of patients with IBD and genuine IBS-type symptoms in the absence of mucosal inflammation. These symptoms had negative effects on psychological well-being and quality of life to the same degree as active IBD. New management strategies are required for this patient group.
2	11	44	Psychology  	 Antisocial personality disorder  	 Case study; Offending behaviour; Autism spectrum disorder; Antisocial personality disorder; Clinical comparison; Pathological demand avoidance        	"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the different clinical features of pathological demand avoidance (PDA) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) presented in the form of a single case study. The study highlights the potential of misdiagnosis and conceptual confusions to practitioners in forensic settings between the two conditions when working with offenders with personality disorders. Design/methodology/approach - A case formulation using the ""five Ps"" method based on the personal history of an incarcerated male is presented and the clinical similarities and differences between PDA and ASPD are delineated. These differences and similarities are evaluated and applied to offender management including intervention options. Findings - There are considerable similarities between ASPD and PDA making the two conditions difficult to separate. Both diagnostic criteria identify childhood behavioural problems, aggression, destructiveness, conduct disorder (CD), manipulation and non-compliance as indications of the disorder. For example, the criteria for later adult ASPD are the presence of childhood antisocial behaviour and CD. However, these behaviours may also be suggestive of the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and non-compliance that are part of PDA. Violent behaviours and aggression can also be perceived in a similar way. Misdiagnosis of PDA as ASPD reduces the efficiency of treatment programmes. Originality/value - The implications of these findings could prove useful in the successful risk management of offenders with PDA. Given the similar behavioural characteristics between PDA and ASPD, the prevalence of PDA among offenders may be higher than observed. The aim of this study is to raise awareness of potential conceptual complications and clinical confusions between the two conditions with a view to aid offender management through case formulation. A large scale study into offenders with PDA would draw attention to the prevalence of the condition as well as its association with offending behaviour."
2	6	39	Psychology  	 Eating disorders  	 bulimia; eating disorders; hormones; midlife; perimenopause; menopause transition; bulimia nervosa        	Eating disorders and related symptoms occur during midlife; however, little is known about their aetiology. It has been hypothesised that perimenopause represents a window of vulnerability for the development or exacerbation of eating disorder symptomatology because, like puberty, perimenopause is a period of reproductive hormone change. We compared symptoms of bulimia nervosa (bulimic symptomatology) assessed via mean scores on a self-report questionnaire in premenopausal and perimenopausal women. We also examined the association between hormone concentrations (reproductive/appetite) and bulimic symptomatology. No mean differences in bulimic symptomatology were observed between premenopause and perimenopause. However, there was a significant positive association between leptin and binge eating. Although no significant associations between reproductive hormones and bulimic symptomatology were observed, additional research is needed to provide definitive information. It is essential to learn more about the aetiology of eating disorders and related symptomatology across the lifespan in order to develop age-relevant treatment and prevention programs.

Using techniques from the theory of persistent linked data structures, the resulting platform delivers automatically version-controlled map and graph abstract data types as a web service. The core of the system is provided by a Hash Array Mapped Trie (HAMT) which is made confluently persistent by path-copying. The system aims to make efficient use of storage, and to have consistent access and update times regardless of the version being accessed or modified.
2	2	35	Psychology  	 Person perception  	 Creativity; Mindset priming; Idea generation; Remote associations        	Attempts at idea generation often produce outputs that are marked by restricted creativity. This lack of originality is often due to responses being tethered to recently activated knowledge and salient examples. The current research tested the hypothesis that implicitly priming creativity results in more creativity (i.e., flexibility). Experiment 1 addressed the potential underlying mechanisms that might lead to such an effect and demonstrated that creativity priming leads to the activation of remote, as opposed to close, associations to a target item. Experiments 2a, 2b, 3, and 4 showed that priming creativity (using two different procedures) leads to more original ideas in a generative task as well as better performance in the remote association task (RAT). These effects occurred independently of the conscious intention to be creative as well as motivational and mood states. Across these studies, the activation of a creative mindset undermined the sources of inflexible and uncreative responding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
1	11	28	ECE 	 Control engineering  	 Plastic concrete; Mix design; Bentonite; Sepiolite; Strength        	Plastic concrete cutoff wall technology has been successfully applied to those water-control engineering projects with higher requirements for seepage control. The quantity and quality of clay, aggregate and cement, determine the appropriateness of plastic concrete. Therefore, in this study, laboratory tests of four diverse mix designs with bentonite and sepiolite clay materials were conducted to determine the most suitable material for concrete. By increasing the clay and cement content, a change was observed in the specimen properties; this change became more obvious with increase in specimen age. By increasing the silt and clay content, there was a noticeable reduction in compressive and tensile strength. The mechanical properties variation of concrete produced with sepiolite is comparable to concrete made with bentonite, which can be recommended under the condition of available sepiolite material and seepage water with high contamination. The improvement and modification of physical specifications of plastic concrete, such as strength permeability and metal adsorption, reduced cracks and increased the operating life of concrete for a variety of engineering structures.

4	0	61	Civil 	 Ambient Intelligence  	 pressure sensor; ambient intelligence; activity recognition        	We demonstrate through a pressure sensor matrix, that weight distribution on feet is influenced by body posture. A small cheap carpet equipped with low precision pressure sensor matrix is already sufficient to detect subtle activities and identity of the person on the carpet. By a 0.4 m(2) matrix of 32 x 32, 12 bit pressure sensors, we achieve 78.7% accuracy for 11 test subjects performing 7 subtle activities (open 7 different drawers or cabinet doors) and 88.6% accuracy in recognizing who has performed the activities. We thus see the potential of using a single carpet as a unified approach in houses to detect how inhabitants interact with the furniture without attaching different sensors onto each single furniture.
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 Down syndrome; emotion recognition; emotion labelling        	Some children with Down syndrome may experience difficulties in recognizing facial emotions, particularly fear, but it is not clear why, nor how such skills can best be facilitated. Using a photo-matching task, emotion recognition was tested in children with Down syndrome, children with nonspecific intellectual disability and cognitively matched, typically developing children (all groups N = 21) under four conditions: veridical vs. exaggerated emotions and emotion-labelling vs. generic task instructions. In all groups, exaggerating emotions facilitated recognition accuracy and speed, with emotion labelling facilitating recognition accuracy. Overall accuracy and speed did not differ in the children with Down syndrome, although recognition of fear was poorer than in the typically developing children and unrelated to emotion label use. Implications for interventions are considered.
3	2	54	MAE 	 Manufacturing engineering  	 Compression sportswear; 3-dimensional computer graphics; anisotropic hyperelastic model; musculoskeletal simulation        	The purpose of this study is to develop a new method for designing compression sportswear from the viewpoint of force by simulation. Applied simulation techniques are 1) skin strain simulation, 2) fabric strain simulation using the anisotropic hyperelastic model, and 3) musculoskeletal simulation. For skin strain simulations, a three dimensional computer graphic (3D-CG) polygon strain was calculated as a skin strain using a 3D-CG model that simulates the human body (CG-Human-Model). The initial strain and the strain caused by physical exercise were given to the polygon model representing the shape of the sportswear (CG-Sportswear-Model). For compression sportswear, the strain of the fabric is approximately the same as skin strain, thus the strain of the CG-Human-Model was given to the CG-Sportswear-Model. In-plane and out-of-plane forces resulting from the CG-Sportswear-Model are calculated using anisotropic hyperelastic models. These forces were given to the musculoskeletal simulation as the external forces, and muscle activity required for any given physical exercise (e. g. swimming motion) was calculated. Information of forces and muscle activity are very useful in designing compression sportswear. It is believed that this new method for designing compression sportswear based on simulation is a sophisticated technique because this method takes into account not only forces resulting from sportswear but also the effect of these forces on physical exercise.

4	3	64	Civil 	 Rainwater Harvesting  	 Arid region; Life cycle cost analysis; Rainwater harvesting system; Rainwater tanks; Reliability analysis; Water conservation        	Water is a scarce resource in arid regions, and hence water harvesting is critically important in these regions for which many different means are adopted including groundwater and rainwater harvesting. This paper examines the feasibility of rainwater harvesting from roof catchments in arid regions of Australia. For this, ten representative locations in the arid regions of Australia are selected. Also, ten different sizes of rainwater tanks ranging from 5 kL to 50 kL and three different combinations of water uses are considered. A model is developed to simulate the performance of a rainwater harvesting (RWH) system. It is found that the reliability of a RWH system is highly dependent on mean annual rainfall at the location of interest. It is found that a 20 kL tank can provide a reliability of 61%-97% for toilet and laundry use depending on the location within the Australian arid regions. At the current water price, RWH system is not financially viable in the Australian arid regions. The methodology adopted in this paper can be adapted to other similar arid regions of the world.

0	4	4	CS 	 Operating systems  	 autophagy; software; IFDOTMETER; immunofluorescence; cell image analysis        	Most laboratories interested in autophagy use different imaging software for managing and analyzing heterogeneous parameters in immunofluorescence experiments (e.g., LC3-puncta quantification and determination of the number and size of lysosomes). One solution would be software that works on a user's laptop or workstation that can access all image settings and provide quick and easy-to-use analysis of data. Thus, we have designed and implemented an application called IFDOTMETER, which can run on all major operating systems because it has been programmed using JAVA (Sun Microsystems). Briefly, IFDOTMETER software has been created to quantify a variety of biological hallmarks, including mitochondrial morphology and nuclear condensation. The program interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it useful for users not familiar with computer handling. By setting previously defined parameters, the software can automatically analyze a large number of images without the supervision of the researcher. Once analysis is complete, the results are stored in a spreadsheet. Using software for high-throughput cell image analysis offers researchers the possibility of performing comprehensive and precise analysis of a high number of images in an automated manner, making this routine task easier.
5	10	82	Medical 	 Bipolar Disorder  	 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; sensitivity and specificity; likelihood ratios; receiver-operating characteristics curve        	Objective: To use receiver-operating characteristics analysis to identify multilevel diagnostic likelihood ratios and provide a framework for the diagnosis of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (5-10 years old) and adolescents (11-18 years old) in an outpatient setting. Method: Caregiver, teacher, and youth reports from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) were obtained for 299 children and 321 adolescents with multiple imputation of missing data. The reference standard was diagnosis of ADHD based on case history and a semistructured diagnostic interview masked to the ASEBA measurements. Results: In children, caregiver-reported Attention Problems (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.74) outperformed all other subscales of the caregiver and teacher measures (AUCs <= 0.72). In the older sample, caregiver- and teacher-reported Attention Problems (caregiver AUC = 0.73; teacher AUC = 0.61) were best at identifying ADHD. Inclusion of caregiver and teacher reports significantly (p <.001 for all comparisons) increased prediction of ADHD diagnosis, whereas youth self-report did not. Conclusion: Caregiver-reported Attention Problems were more useful than teacher-reports and self-report in identifying ADHD. Combining caregiver and teacher reports improved identification. Multilevel likelihood ratios are provided to facilitate routine clinical use.
1	9	25	ECE 	 Analog signal processing  	 biosensor; flow system; biomolecular computing; noise reduction; signal processing        	We consider flow systems that have been utilized for small-scale biomolecular computing and digital signal processing in binary-operating biosensors. Signal measurement is optimized by designing a flow-reversal cuvette and analyzing the experimental data to theoretically extract the pulse shape, as well as reveal the level of noise it possesses. Noise reduction is then carried out numerically. We conclude that this can be accomplished physically via the addition of properly designed well-mixing flow-reversal cell(s) as an integral part of the flow system. This approach should enable improved networking capabilities and potentially not only digital but analog signal-processing in such systems. Possible applications in complex biocomputing networks and various sense-and-act systems are discussed.
4	1	62	Civil 	 Geotextile  	 Fly ash; Slope; Steel grid reinforcement; Backfill; Strip loading; UDL; Coverage ratio        	Fly ash, waste by-product from coal industries, is being used extensively in construction of highway and railway embankments. This paper describes the effectiveness of steel grid reinforcement in the form of planar mattress along with jute geotextile at facia throughout the slope and with fly ash as backfill material. The models were subjected to loading in the form of uniform and strip loading by means of rigid steel plates as footings. Series of laboratory model tests were carried out on homogeneous unreinforced and reinforced fly ash slopes with slope angle 60 degrees on rigid base to check the efficacy of reinforcement in improving the load carrying capacity and stability of slope. For fly ash slope on rigid base, length of the reinforcement was varied from 0.7H to 0.2H (H = Height of the slope). The steel reinforcement having grid thickness of 1.2 mm with square openings of 15 mm was laid along the width of the slope in continuous form as well as with coverage ratios (C-r) of 0.5 and 0.6. All the tests were conducted by applying both uniformly distributed load (UDL) and strip loading until failure. Based on the experimental results, for all types of reinforcement cases, slope with continuous grid of length 0.7H supports maximum for strip loading before failure as compared to UDL. The variation in length of the reinforcement showed significant effect on the settlement of the backfill.
2	1	34	Psychology  	 Social cognition  	 Parkinson's disease; Depressive symptoms; Cortical thickness; Longitudinal analysis        	Introduction: Depressive symptoms are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant impact on the quality of life. Methods: The present study analyzed the correlations between over-time changes in depressive symptoms and gray matter parameters of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in non-demented PD patients. Results: A significant correlation was observed, between increased scores for depression over time and lower cortical thickness over time in the right temporo-parietal junction, right occipital medial region, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right posterior cingulate region, left middle temporal as well as left supplementary motor area. Furthermore, the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted increased cortical thinning over time in the left middle temporal, left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate and right parahippocampal cortices. Finally, a statistically significant negative correlation has been revealed between the thalamus' volume changes over time and the change in depressive symptoms scores. All other analyzed subcortical structures didn't reveal any significant correlations. Conclusion: These results suggest that depressive symptoms in PD patients are associated with gray matter cortical thinning and thalamus volume shrinkage over time and higher scores of depressive symptoms at baseline correlate with a higher rate of cortical thinning longitudinally. The present study highlights the importance of addressing depressive symptoms in PD patients early in the disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
3	0	52	MAE 	 computer-aided design  	 CdTe; electron-beam-induced current (EBIC); grain boundary (GB); technology computer aided design (TCAD)        	We conduct 2-D simulations of device structures typical of electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging and solar cell structures for p-type CdTe absorber layers with charged grain boundaries. A large signal enhancement is found near depleted (positively charged) grain boundaries for EBIC simulation, but in contrast with previous claims, solar cell performance drops. In contrast, little EBIC contrast is seen, but the cell performance improves when accumulated (negatively charged) grain boundaries are introduced. We explore the impact of doping level, lifetimes, and grain boundary charge to provide insight for design of improved thin film solar cells.
1	10	27	ECE 	 Satellite radio  	 Rainfall; rain rate; quasi-periodic cycles; historical time series; de-integration; radio propagation; satellite radio links; terrestrial radio links; coomunication system design        	We show that significant quasi-periodic cycles are present in century-long rain rate experimental statistics in Milan (Italy): a) in the number of rainy days in a year; b) in the average duration of daily rainy time and average duration of rain events, and in 1-min rain rate complementary probability distributions (pds, for short), obtained by de-integrating historical time series of daily rainfall pds with a recently published de-integration theory. An FFT analysis shows that significant power is at periods of 14.0, 16.0, 21.0 29.0, 41.0 years. The cyclic nature of rain rate is clearly evident in the time series of 1-min rain rate exceeded annually with probability (fraction of time) 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%. The impact on communication design is direct because rain attenuation pds follow the same trend. Future work should concern other localities and the potential use of these results for predicting 1-min rain rate pds.

6	0	125	biochemistry 	 Molecular biology  	 Consensus; guidelines; management; medulloblastoma        	Introduction: The high success rate in the management medulloblastoma achieved in the western world is not exactly mirrored in developing countries including India. Socio-demographic differences, health-care disparity, and lack in uniformity of care with resultant widespread variations in the clinical practice are some of the reasons that may partly explain this difference in outcomes. Patients with medulloblastoma require a multi-disciplinary team approach involving but not limited to neuro-radiology, neurosurgery; neuropathology, molecular biology, radiation oncology, pediatric medical oncology and rehabilitative services for optimizing outcomes. Methods: The Indian Society of Neuro-Oncology (ISNO) constituted an expert multi-disciplinary panel with adequate representation from all stakeholders to prepare national consensus guidelines for the contemporary management of medulloblastoma. Results: Minimum desirable, as well as preferable though optional recommendations (as appropriate), were developed and adopted for the pre-surgical work-up including neuroimaging; neurosurgical management including surgical principles, techniques, and complications; neuropathology reporting and molecular testing; contemporary risk-stratification in the molecular era; appropriate adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy); and follow-up schedule in medulloblastoma. Conclusions: The current document represents a broad consensus reached amongst various stakeholders within the neuro-oncology community involved in the contemporary curative-intent management of children with medulloblastoma. It provides both general as well as specific guidelines and recommendations to be adopted by physicians and health care providers across India to achieve uniformity of care, improve disease-related outcomes, and compare results between institutions within the country.
0	12	12	CS 	 Symbolic computation  	 Fluid; plasma or ferromagnetic thin film; (2+1)-dimensional Bogoyavlenskii-Kadontsev-Petviashili equation; Bell polynomial; Hirota method; conservation laws        	In this paper, we investigate a (2+ 1)-dimensional Bogoyavlenskii-Kadontsev-Petviashili equation in a fluid, plasma or ferromagnetic thin film. Through the Bell polynomials, Hirota method and symbolic computation, the one-and two-kink-soliton solutions are derived. Backlund transformation, Lax pair and conservation laws are presented. Elastic collisions including the oblique, parallel, unidirectional and bidirectional collisions between the two-kink solitons are discussed. In addition, the relation between the velocities and wave numbers of the two-kink solitons are analysed. When wave numbers b(j) >0, upsilon(jx), the velocities in the x axis, increase with wave numbers a(j) increasing. With b(j) increasing, upsilon(jx) increase when a(j)(4) - 3b(2) j >0, while decrease when a(j)(4) - 3b(j)(2) < 0. upsilon(jy), the velocities in the y axis, increase with a(j) increasing and b(j) decreasing.
