{"doc_token": "background: stress has been shown to negatively impact surgical performance, and surgical novices are particularly susceptible to its effects. mental skills are psychological strategies designed to enhance performance and reduce the impact of stress to consistently facilitate the ideal mental conditions that enable performers to perform their best. mental skills have been used routinely in other high-stress domains (e.g., with navy seals, military pilots, elite athletes, and so forth) to facilitate optimal performance in challenging situations. we have developed a novel mental skills curriculum (msc) to aid surgical trainees in optimizing their performance under stressful conditions. the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of this msc in reducing novices' stress. methods: the msc was implemented with a convenience sample of surgical novices over 8 wk. two stress tests were administered before and after completion of the msc to assess its effectiveness in reducing trainee stress. the trier social stress test (tsst) is a validated method of measuring participants' stress responses; it was implemented by giving participants 10 min to prepare for an impromptu presentation and 5 min to present it in front of a medical education expert who would be assessing them. the o'connor tweezer dexterity test (otdt) is a test of fine motor dexterity; participants competed against each other in small groups who would complete the test the fastest. such competition has been shown to cause acute stress in performers. to assess stress, heart rate (hr), perceived stress (stai-6), and perceived workload (nasa-tlx) were completed during all testing sessions. results: nine novices (age 23 +/- 7 y, 55% women) completed the msc. hr increased significantly from resting to performance during the tsst and from early during competition (at 2 min and 30s of elapsed time) to immediately after completing the task. however, participants perceived less stress during and immediately after the tsst and otdt tests (p < 0.05) after completion of the msc. in addition, they reported significantly less workload during the second otdt administration (p < 0.05) and showed a trend toward faster completion of this test. conclusions: the novel msc was effective at reducing surgical novices' perceived stress and workload during two comprehensive stress tests. although not statistically significant, participant 's enhanced performance during the otdt is encouraging. this curriculum may be valuable to help inexperienced learners reduce stress in a variety of situations related to learning and performing surgical skills. additional research using a larger sample size is currently underway to validate the effectiveness of this curriculum.

{"doc_token": "with the increasing amount of interconnections between vehicles, the attack surface of internal vehicle networks is rising steeply. although these networks are shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal security to protect against malicious components or adversaries who can breach the network perimeter. to secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be allowed to send and receive-messages. this is achieved through the use of an authentication framework. cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties and provide secure communication channels (e.g., internet communication). however, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. in particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during vehicle operation. in this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols for automotive systems. we present lightweight authentication for secure automotive networks (lasan), a full lifecycle authentication approach. we describe the core lasan protocols and show how they protect the internal vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low computational resources of this domain. by lever-aging the fixed structure of automotive networks, we minimize bandwidth and computation requirements. unlike previous work, we also explain how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive product lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates. we evaluate lasan in two different ways: first, we analyze the security properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques based on formal methods. second, we evaluate the timing requirements of lasan and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.", "doc_label": ["CS", "Cryptography"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"doc_token": "in recent years, more and more research has been conducted in close collaboration with manufacturers to design robust and profitable dismantling systems. thus, engineers and designers of new products have to consider constraints and disassembly specifications during the design phase of products not only in the context of the end of life but more precisely in the product life cycle. consequently, optimization of disassembly process of complex products is essential in the case of preventive maintenance. in fact, disassembly sequence plan (dsp), which is among the combinatorial problems with hard constraints in practical engineering, becomes an np-hard problem. in this research work, an automated dsp process based on a metaheuristic method named \"\"ant colony optimization\"\" is developed. beginning with a computer aided design (cad) model, a collision analysis is performed to identify all possible interferences during the components' motion and then an interference matrix is generated to identify dynamically the disassembly parts and to ensure the feasibility of disassembly operations. the novelty of the developed approach is presented in the introduction of new criteria such as the maintainability of the usury component with several other criteria as volume, tools change and disassembly directions change. finally, to highlight the performance of the developed approach, an implemented tool is developed and an industrial case is studied. the obtained results prove the satisfactory side of these criteria to identify a feasible dsp in a record time.", "doc_label": ["MAE", "computer-aided design"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"doc_token": "during the last decade, the leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) rating system has embodied the efforts of the u.s. green building council (usgbc) to recognize buildings designed to achieve superior performance in several areas including energy consumption. given the emergent interest in improving buildings' energy efficiency, researchers have generated predictive physical and data-driven models for energy consumption. although the physical approaches aiming to calculate the energy consumption behavior at the building level are accurate, the necessity of continuously inspecting and gathering data for all the input parameters often makes these approaches impractical in some applications. the objective of this study is to introduce a novel assessment method that investigates the correlation between leed certification and the actual energy consumption by investigating a case study of leed-certified research buildings in climate zone 2b. the research approach first consists of developing and testing eight performance models for 13 non-leed buildings, and then inspecting the fit of the best model to five comparable leed certified buildings. heating, cooling, and electricity data are collected from all buildings, in addition to multiple weather, time, and building characteristics variables. the data are used to generate several regression models that predict the energy consumption of conventional research buildings. the results show the differences in energy use between leed and non-leed buildings are not as large as anticipated. this paper contributes to the body of knowledge by first introducing a novel generic assessment method for leed buildings and second applying this method to a case study sample of leed-certified research buildings in climate zone 2b. the findings of this paper support the actual performance assessment of leed buildings by helping practitioners make better decisions throughout the project life. in order to ensure a fair and representative assessment of the leed certification system, future studies are invited to adopt this new method while comparing the actual performance of leed buildings to that of non-leed +buildings.
