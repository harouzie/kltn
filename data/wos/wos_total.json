{"doc_token": "the theory of three-way decisions is to consider a decision-making problem as a ternary classification one which is realized by the acceptance, rejection and non-commitment. recently, this theory has been integrated with formal concept analysis in two different ways: constructive and axiomatic methods. the constructive method is to define certain three-way concepts in a formal context to support three-way concept analysis, while the axiomatic one is to characterize general three-way concepts by axioms so as to perform three-way concept learning. nevertheless, there are similarities between the constructive and the axiomatic methods. in fact, both three-way concept analysis induced by the constructive method and three-way concept learning induced by the axiomatic one are realized by incorporating the idea of ternary classification into the design of extent or intent of a concept. however, their information fusion abilities need to be improved since neither of them is able to deal with large or multi-source data effectively. motivated by this problem, our paper is to reconsider three-way concept learning based on cognitive operators from the perspective of information fusion. that is, the parallel computing techniques of learning three-way concepts are developed for large and multi-source data. specifically, for large data, the relationship between the global granular concept and the local ones is first clarified, and then it is employed to design an information fusion algorithm. for multi-source data, the whole evaluation function used to induce three-way decisions is established by aggregating the results obtained in each single-source data, and three-way concept learning is made by constructing lower and upper approximation concepts. finally, we conduct some numerical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed parallel computing algorithms.

{"doc_token": "current concepts of growth hydraulics in higher plants are critically revisited, and it is concluded that they partly fail to interpret the experimental data adequately, particularly in the case of hydroponics-grown roots. theoretical considerations indicate that the growth rate in roots is controlled by the extensibility of the cell wall, excluding water availability (i.e. hydraulic conductance) as a major constraint. this is supported by the findings that the growth rate does not scale with turgor, and that no radial nor axial water potential gradients have been observed in the root elongation zone. nevertheless, a water potential deficit ranging from -0.2 to -0.6 mpa has repeatedly been reported for growing cells that by far exceeds the shallow trans-membrane water potential difference required for the uptake of growth water. unexpectedly, growth was also shown to depend on the hydraulic conductance (lp) of the plasma membrane of root cells, even though lp should generally be too large to have an impact on growth. for leaves, similar observations have been reported, but the interpretation of the data is less straightforward. inconsistencies associated with the current model of growth hydraulics prompt the author to suggest a revised model that comprises, in addition to a passive mechanism of water transport across the plasma membrane of growing cells mediated by aquaporins ('leak') a secondary active water transport ('pump'), in analogy to a mechanism previously demonstrated for mammalian epithelia and postulated for xylem parenchyma cells in roots. water is hypothesised to be secreted against a trans-membrane water potential difference by cotransport with solutes (salts, sugars, and/or amino acids), taking advantage of the free energy released by this transport step. the solute concentration gradient is supposed to be maintained by a subsequent retrieval of the solutes from the apoplast and back-transport at the expense of metabolic energy. water secretion tends to reduce the turgor pressure and retards growth, but turgor and, in turn, growth can be upregulated very rapidly independent from any adjustment in the osmolyte deposition rate by increasing lp and/or reducing secondary active water transport, e.g. when the root is exposed to mild osmotic stress, as confirmed by experimental studies.", "doc_label": ["MAE", "Hydraulics"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"doc_token": "introduction: the high success rate in the management medulloblastoma achieved in the western world is not exactly mirrored in developing countries including india. socio-demographic differences, health-care disparity, and lack in uniformity of care with resultant widespread variations in the clinical practice are some of the reasons that may partly explain this difference in outcomes. patients with medulloblastoma require a multi-disciplinary team approach involving but not limited to neuro-radiology, neurosurgery; neuropathology, molecular biology, radiation oncology, pediatric medical oncology and rehabilitative services for optimizing outcomes. methods: the indian society of neuro-oncology (isno) constituted an expert multi-disciplinary panel with adequate representation from all stakeholders to prepare national consensus guidelines for the contemporary management of medulloblastoma. results: minimum desirable, as well as preferable though optional recommendations (as appropriate), were developed and adopted for the pre-surgical work-up including neuroimaging; neurosurgical management including surgical principles, techniques, and complications; neuropathology reporting and molecular testing; contemporary risk-stratification in the molecular era; appropriate adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy); and follow-up schedule in medulloblastoma. conclusions: the current document represents a broad consensus reached amongst various stakeholders within the neuro-oncology community involved in the contemporary curative-intent management of children with medulloblastoma. it provides both general as well as specific guidelines and recommendations to be adopted by physicians and health care providers across india to achieve uniformity of care, improve disease-related outcomes, and compare results between institutions within the country.", "doc_label": ["biochemistry", "Molecular biology"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"doc_token": "in this paper, we investigate a (2+ 1)-dimensional bogoyavlenskii-kadontsev-petviashili equation in a fluid, plasma or ferromagnetic thin film. through the bell polynomials, hirota method and symbolic computation, the one-and two-kink-soliton solutions are derived. backlund transformation, lax pair and conservation laws are presented. elastic collisions including the oblique, parallel, unidirectional and bidirectional collisions between the two-kink solitons are discussed. in addition, the relation between the velocities and wave numbers of the two-kink solitons are analysed. when wave numbers b(j) >0, upsilon(jx), the velocities in the x axis, increase with wave numbers a(j) increasing. with b(j) increasing, upsilon(jx) increase when a(j)(4) - 3b(2) j >0, while decrease when a(j)(4) - 3b(j)(2) < 0. upsilon(jy), the velocities in the y axis, increase with a(j) increasing and b(j) decreasing.", "doc_label": ["CS", "Symbolic computation"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
