## Hierarchy-aware Multi-label Text Classification

### Introduction

This repository contains the code for my graduation thesis project on "Hierarchy-aware Multi-label Text Classification". The project explores the use of hierarchical structures in text classification tasks, particularly focusing on multi-label classification.

### Project Description

The project investigates the following key aspects:

* **Hierarchical Text Representation:** Develop methods to incorporate hierarchical information into text representations for improved classification performance.
* **Multi-label Classification:** Design and implement models capable of predicting multiple relevant labels for each text sample.
* **Evaluation and Analysis:** Evaluate the performance of the proposed models on benchmark datasets and analyze the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach.

### Framework Used

The project utilizes various technologies and libraries, including:

* **Python:** Programming language for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
* **fairseq:**: A sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language modeling and other text generation tasks.
* **transformers:**: State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

### Datasets

The project utilizes several benchmark datasets for multi-label text classification, including:

**WOS (Web of Science):** A dataset of scientific articles with multiple topic labels.
**NYT (New York Times):** A dataset of news articles with multiple topic labels.
**RCV1 (Reuters Corpus Volume 1):** A dataset of news articles with multiple topic labels.

### Results and Discussion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical approach in improving multi-label text classification performance. The results are presented and discussed in detail in the thesis document.

### Future Work

The project opens up several avenues for future research, including:

* Exploring more complex hierarchical structures for text representation.
* Investigating the use of attention mechanisms for capturing label relationships.
* Developing novel evaluation metrics for hierarchical multi-label classification.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* `/`: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
* `data/`: Contains the preprocessed datasets used in the project.
* `models/`: Contains the source code for the implemented models.
* `config/`: Configuration files
